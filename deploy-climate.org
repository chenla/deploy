* Introduction

Niels Bohr famously said, "Those who are not shocked when they first
come across quantum theory cannot possibly have understood it."
Climate change is the same, if Climate Change doesn't terrify you at
an existential level, you don't understand it.  No, it's not that bad,
it's worse, much worse.

Mankind is playing a very dangerous game that could have as big an
impact on the planet and our species than an all out thermonuclear war
between superpowers.

It's important to understand that the world is not a Greek Tragedy,
there is no such thing as fate, divine retribution or divine
intervention for that matter.  We are unique as a species in that we
have the power, knowledge, and resources to fix our planet.  But this
won't happen quickly and it won't be easy.  The damage we have done is
on the very edge of being all but irreversible.

We have all been taught from childhood to mistrust the veracity of
apocolyptic predictions.  The story of Chicken Little is never far
from our awareness, because we seem to be programed to almost /want/
to believe in the end of the world.  Our religions, mythologies, and
popular culture is packed with epidemics, earthquakes, floods,
asteroids, alien invasions and more recently, zombies.  And in most of
these stories there is a Chicken Little character who heroically tries
to warn people, to no avail and everyone dies.

The Chicken Little story is told to children (and adults) because in
most cases there are no monsters.  It's a coping mechanism, so we
don't get so scared that we turn away and shut down and do nothing.

*Newt*: My mommy always said there were no monsters - no real ones -
but there are.

*Ripley*: Yes, there are, aren't there?

*Newt*: Why do they tell little kids that?

*Ripley*: Most of the time it's true. 

-- Aliens (1986)

And it's all too true that most predictions of the end of the world
are patently absurd, and only believed by the gullible and in times of
great stress, it is comforting to escape into fantasy.  Because the
end of times, as fortold in religious stories is only an apocolypse
for bad people.  The believers are always told that they will either
survive or that they will be rewarded for their belief in an
afterlife.

So when the real monsters do come, as with Hilter, people don't want
to believe that they could exist, so they turn away and shut down
rather than face the truth.  And when cataclysms do happen, such as
earthquakes, volcanos and tsunamis, the survivers rationalize their
survival by believing that it was because of divine intervention, not
wanting to confront the ugly truth that divinity stepped in to save
them, but not the innocents who died next to them.  Cognitive
dissonance is easier to live with than a complex chaotic universe
where your fate is governed by blind chance.
