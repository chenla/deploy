* Introduction

Niels Bohr famously said, "Those who are not shocked when they first
come across quantum theory cannot possibly have understood it."
Climate change is the same, if Climate Change doesn't terrify you at
an existential level, you cannot possibly to have understood it.  No,
it's not that bad, it's worse, much worse.

Mankind is playing a very dangerous game that could have as big an
impact on the planet and our species than an all out thermonuclear war
between superpowers.
