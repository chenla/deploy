Bands are an important demarcation, in that they are the ideal and
natural size for egaltarian societies of 100 or less individuals.


#+begin_quote
In his 1972 study, /The Notion of the Tribe/, Morton Fried defined bands
as small, mobile, and fluid social formations with weak leadership
that do not generate surpluses, pay taxes nor support a standing army.

Bands are distinguished from tribes in that tribes are generally
larger, consisting of many families. Tribes have more social
institutions, such as a chief, big man, or elders. Tribes are also
more permanent than bands; a band can cease to exist if only a small
group splits off or dies. Many tribes are sub-divided into
bands.  Historically, some tribes were formed from bands that came
together from time to time for religious ceremonies, hunting, or
warfare.
