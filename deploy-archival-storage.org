* Introduction

The folks at Group 47 and the Rosetta project were right, the only
success long-term storageis visual.  Digital encoding is too brittle
for long-term storage that can survive the five causes of loosing
information:

  - error
  - human accident
  - disaster
  - temporary insanity
  - benign neglect

One challenge is to be able to round-trip images to digital and back
again without loss.   Images are always a tradeoff becuase they are
dependent on resolution.  Digitization of analog images and audio are
also limited by sampling size -- which some argue can never completely
reproduce sounds recorded on analogue media.

Digital recordings now far surpass physical  human perceptional
limits, but it's unsure how far we need to go beyond that.  How high
will image and audio resolution need to go before we reach a point of
diminishing returns?

The resolution has a few more iterations to go.  The Likelyhood is
that movies will get to at least 8k, because of the large screens, and
the equivalance to 75mm film. A push to 12k or 16k will likely be to
provide 4-8k for 3D support per eye. Higher resolutions would exist to
support reconnaissance and other situations where zooming in on an
image would be important or for Immense screens.

* Significant Whitespace

Image based archives provide a wonderful opportunity to do much more
than capture images of text and images.  We can incorporate design as
a means of providing meaning and context -- if this is done right,
then we can use whitespace as a significant part of markup -- they key
here is to be consistent, and to have a standard that is used across
each edition that is then described in rulesets that are machine
understandable.  This will include everything from fonts, links,
metadata, references, comments, glosses etc which correspond to a
digital marked up version of the file that will be both semantic and a
form of graphic and typographic design that is both human and machine
readable and hopefully, beautiful as well.

I think that this is where our invocation language will really be
important....  I have hoped that the language would be able to use
existing chinese characters but we really do need only a few hundred
characters which would get confused with existing ideographs -- but I
still think that we can base the invocation ideographs on chinese
characters.  It might not be a bad idea to go back to seal script and
use that as a starting point -- so that characters won't be ideographs
but true hieroglyphs that are independent of other spoken or written
languages.



* Long Term Storage

Group 47 has a good [[http://group47.com/challenges-of-archival-storage-of-digital-data/][list]] of links about the challenges of digital storage.


 - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_data_storage][Computer data storage]] | Wikipedia

   - primary storage (memory)
   - Secondary storage (also known as external memory or auxiliary storage)
   - Tertiary storage or tertiary memory

I prefer online, nearline, offline

* Rosetta Project

Rosetta was/is a brilliant project that in some ways was doomed to be
a one-off.  It was a bit expensive, used proprietary technology to
encode it and the contents of what was recorded as far as I can tell
is not in the public domain, or even digitized except as images.  So
this was a time-capsule project -- not a living archive that would
have continuity over long time periods.  The second problem is that it
really is like the rosetta stone -- its a massive bunch of parallel
texts and word lists.

The technology used to make the disk is from Norsam technologies.

The time-scales for microetched nickle for very long term storage is
very good, but the system doesn't look like it will be feasible as a
solution for large scale distributed archival storage.

* MDISC: Stone DVD 

M-DISC is another billiant technology which leverages DVD and Blu-ray
discs made of stone which have an expected lifespan of up to 1,000
years.

The two problems with this is that they top out at 100GB using BD-XL
Blu-ray.  The chances of blueray players being around for a 1,000
years is problematic -- and because DVD and Blueray were concocted by
the entertainment industry there is all sorts of encoding cruft that
will not age well.

* DOTS

DOTS uses archvial tape image archival storage system.

The system holds 1TB in a cartridge, lasts at least 100 years, it
seems to be tolerant of a wide range of environmental conditions
(except acid -- three hours in Sprite degraded the media).

There is a "leader" at the beginning of each tape that provides
instructions on how to contruct a microscope that can read the images.

The system also incorporates the LTFS file system that makes it easier
for automated systems to retrieve specific frames.
