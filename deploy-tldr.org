   Among Victorian Novelists[[‚Ü±]], [[Charles Dickens]]‚á≤ stands out

 - Timeline

Technological revolutions break up centralized systems into
a distributed system where the power is at the edge of the
networks.  Over time, consolidation occurs into a
decentralized network made up of a large number of medium
sized organizations.  Finally these mid-sized organizations
consolidate into a handful or even a single organization
that monopolizes the network.

As networks consolidate into decentralized and then
centralized systems, innovation slows down, creating a
power-wealth-value imbalance that is not sustainable.

In 2017 the Internet & The Web, which started as a
distributed network, consolidated to the point where the
number of players can almost be counted on one hand.

We are at the beginning of no less than five revolutions;
artificial intelligence, robotics, nanotech, trustless
distributed networks (based on cryptography, hashes, and
distributed ledgers) and a biological revolution based on
gene splicing technologies such as CRSPR.

Any one of these technologies alone would constitute change
at the same scale as Gutenberg's Press, The Industrial
Revolution, The Computer and Internet Revolutions.  Taken
together each of these revolutions will amplify, and
reinforce each other.  The next 5-20 years will
fundamentally reshape business, finance, manufacturing,
transportation, energy, agriculture, medicine, education,
government and the world order.  Simply put, we are seeing
changes that will transform human civilization to the point
that it can be called a Singularity; a future that we can
not predict or even imagine today.


** Towards a Distributed Civilization

 - more than resilient : develop infrastructure that is not
   only resilient to catastrophe, but is anti-fragile, that
   becomes stronger, the more it is challenged.  At the
   heart of this is ensuring that the knowledge and
   experience to build and maintain our civilization is
   distributed as widely, in time and space as possible.
   Publication is not enough, living knowlege and experience
   is as important as any recorded publication.

 - empowering the edges : ensure that everyone has access
   and opportunitiy to use all of these technologies to
   build and maintain a good life for their families and
   future generations.

 - the long now, and big here : thinking and acting over
   very long time frames through the development of
   sustainable and balanced systems that work in the real
   world, not just in academic books and scientific papers.

 - managing climate & ecosystems : unintentionally, man has
   brought the xx millenia of the interglacial period that
   has provided mankind with a mild and hospitible climate.
   Climate change will pose momumental challenges for our
   species and the planet.  We must stop thinking that man
   is not part of the natural world, without the natural
   world, we would be extinct. To this end we must learn to
   become respnsible stewards of the climate and ecosystems
   that give us life.  This goes beyond reversing or just
   mitigating climate change, it has to become a core part
   of our self identity and understanding that our lives
   depend on us getting this right.


* TL;TD III : Implementation

** Table of Contents
** Introduction

The work of the institute is meant to be both deployable as
well as academic and scientific.  It's been said that it
takes an industrial civilization to build an industrial
civilization.  The same is true for distributed
civilizations as well.  The Institute will build and work
using distributed infrastructure which will be a combination
of existing technologies, as well as our own implementation
of the pieces that are still missing but will be required
for the infrastructure to work in practice as well as it
does in theory.  This section outlines the technologies that
we and the missing pieces that we will complete development at
the Institute.
