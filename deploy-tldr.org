Not surprisingly, this doesn't work well with monospace

   Among Victorian Novelists[[↱]], [[Charles Dickens]]⇲ stands out
   as perhaps the best known [[English Novelist]]↱ of the
   [[Nineteenth Century]]↪, who is known for his novela [[A
   Christmas Carol]]↳ and his novel [[Great Expectations]]↳.

* The Yellow Brick Road

** Towards a Distributed Civilization

 - more than resilient : develop infrastructure that is not
   only resilient to catastrophe, but is anti-fragile, that
   becomes stronger, the more it is challenged.  At the
   heart of this is ensuring that the knowledge and
   experience to build and maintain our civilization is
   distributed as widely, in time and space as possible.
   Publication is not enough, living knowlege and experience
   is as important as any recorded publication.

 - empowering the edges : ensure that everyone has access
   and opportunitiy to use all of these technologies to
   build and maintain a good life for their families and
   future generations.

 - the long now, and big here : thinking and acting over
   very long time frames through the development of
   sustainable and balanced systems that work in the real
   world, not just in academic books and scientific papers.

 - managing climate & ecosystems : unintentionally, man has
   brought the xx millenia of the interglacial period that
   has provided mankind with a mild and hospitible climate.
   Climate change will pose momumental challenges for our
   species and the planet.  We must stop thinking that man
   is not part of the natural world, without the natural
   world, we would be extinct. To this end we must learn to
   become respnsible stewards of the climate and ecosystems
   that give us life.  This goes beyond reversing or just
   mitigating climate change, it has to become a core part
   of our self identity and understanding that our lives
   depend on us getting this right.


* TL;TD III : Implementation

** Table of Contents
** Introduction

The work of the institute is meant to be both deployable as
well as academic and scientific.  It's been said that it
takes an industrial civilization to build an industrial
civilization.  The same is true for distributed
civilizations as well.  The Institute will build and work
using distributed infrastructure which will be a combination
of existing technologies, as well as our own implementation
of the pieces that are still missing but will be required
for the infrastructure to work in practice as well as it
does in theory.  This section outlines the technologies that
we and the missing pieces that we will complete development at
the Institute.

** A New Distributed Network Layer 

** Interplanetary File System

** Cryptocurrencies

** Neural Nets

** Missing Pieces
