* Facts of Life

We really need to start at the big bang because it is what
establish the fundamental physical laws of the unverse.
This isn't abstract abstract shit -- it determines how and
what works and what doesn't.

 - gravity
 - entropy & thermodynamics
 - space, matter, energy, time

Models are maps in more than 2 dimensions



* The Rest


We start with the basic unit being a planetary body.  Not just planets
but planetiods including moons and large asteroids suitible for
building habitats.

* Structure of the Earth

Earth has a core which is broken down into an inner core of solid
iron that gives the planet it's magnetic field (important for
sheilding life from solar and cosmic radiation) which is surrounded by
a molten core, which is surrounded by a semi stable mantle which makes
up the bulk of the planet's mass.  The mantle has a more stable upper
mantle which is then surrounded by a thin crust.  The more stable part
of the upper mantle and the crust are what we live on and are made up
of tectonic plates that move over time and rearrange the continents
and oceans.  This is known as the lithosphere.

Above the Lithosphere is the hydrosphere, which inludes all water in
the oceans and any water vapour in the atmosphere.  Above the
lithosphere is the atmosphere which is the razor thin mixture of
mostly nitrogen and 20% oxygen (and trace elements) what we live in.

Finally, the biosphere is the region between the bottom of the
hydrosphere and the bottom part of the atmosphere that can sustain
life.

It's easy to forget how small the atmosphere and hydrosphere is
relative to the size of the planet.

  [ [ IMAGE ] ] 

* Biosphere

Life on the planet is divided into three primary environments,
terrestrial, fresh water and marine.

These are then in turn broken into different regions called /biomes/
which are characterized by their elevation (or depth in water
environments) atmospheric pressure, rainfall, sunlight, temperature
and soil.

Each biome is broken into smaller biotope which has a specific
collection of plants, animals and micro organisms.  Species of plants
and animals belong to specific biotopes and may differ between
biotopes even within the same biome as sub-species.

The biosphere is governed by the rotation of the earth which allows
the planet to evenly heat and cool, as well as seasonal heating and
cooling from the planet's orbit as it orbits closer or farther from
the sun.

The moon provide gravitational tidal effects which help increase
movement of water in oceans and lakes, as well as in the atmosphere.
Heating and cooling keeps air and water moving around the planet.

The poles recieve less sun than lower latitudes, and variations in the
length of day and night that increases as you move from the equator to
the poles.

The biosphere has water cycles which evaporates water into the
atmosphere, which precipitates back to the surface as rain or snow.
Which then runs off the surface of the planet into rivers and
eventually in the ocean.  Some of that water seeps into the
lithosphere and replentishes underground water stores.

There is a carbon cycle that is powered by plant and animal life.
Plants take in CO2 and spit out Oxygen.  Animals then take oxygen and
spit out CO2.

There is also a Nitrogen Cycle which is used by plants that cycles
nitrogen from the atmosphere to the soil and back again.

* Pace layers

This is a good place to introduce Steward Brand's concept of pace
layers.

Different things change at different speeds.

There are pace layers in nature
There are pace layers in civilization
There are pace layers in buildings

Slower layers govern and put a limit on the rate of faster layers

When layers get too far out of sync -- things break, and collapse and
very bad things happen that bring the different layers back into
balance.

For now we should understand how pace layers work on planetary and
geologic scales.

We could start at the penultimate scale which is the scale of our
universe and move down to layers within galaxies and then the life
cycle of stars.  But we will leave that as an exercise for another
time.  We are interested here in pace layers of a planet like earth.

The lithosphere is a pace layer -- with tecnonic plates chaning very
slowly over hundreds of millions of years.

Above that is the biosphere which encompasses all life and how it
helps to manage heat, provides a buffer from external forces such as
radiation in the form of ozone and a blanket of gases that absorb
radiation and regulate rainfall (????)

The atmosphere is largely a creation of life on the planet -- so is
soil and much in the oceans.

These things change at evolutionary time scales measured in millions
and perhaps tens or hundreds of thousand of years at the least.

When things get out of sync bad things happen -- hot house earth was
one 

4 of the 5 major extinction events which trigger climatic change that
results in wiping out at least 70% of species on the planet happened
because the biosphere was out of wack.

Each extinction event cleared out the dead wood, reset the system and
made way for evolution to speed up and create ever more complex and
varied life.

Humans have thrown a spanner in the works -- and is now seriously
messing with a very pleasant interglacial period that made human
civilization possible.  Our population has soared beyond the
biosphere's natural carrying capacity and is set to climb to around 10
billion before it will steeply drop off in the next century.  If any
other species had come even close to doing this, they would have
collapsed and died off.  But mankind has been able to artifically
extend carrying capacity again and again -- but it has come at a
terrible cost which we will soon have to pay.  It's very much
uncertain if we can innovate our way past this, until population
returns to a sustainable level and the biosphere can heal and bring
the climate back into the equilibrium that we have enjoyed for the
past xxx years.


we will come back to pace layers several more times.
--- 

The two World Wars were a result of different pace layers being so out
of sync that the world order had become destablized -- culture and
governance had not changed enough to keep pace with technology
infrastructure and fashion.  In a very distructive fashion, the ways
cleared away the old political systems and institutional and religious
relics that were so entrenched and loath to change that they collapsed
and made way for the final stage of industrialization, and the global
transporation, banking, legal infrastructure that industrialization
demanded.  It cleared the way for civil rights, womens rights, workers
rights, science and the expansion of education across economic and
class boundries that was needed to fill the jobs that
industrialization required.

The world today is still largely organized as an industrialized
civilization.  The problem with this, is that the industrial era gave
way to the globalization era starting in 1990, and the world and the
older industrialized political, social and economic infrastructure,
governance and education has not adapted to the new order.  Making the
changes needed to bring these layers back in sync would be hard
enough, but it is about to be be compounded exponentially by a third
revolution that will likely begin by the end of this decade
(around 2020) that will dwarf the changes of both industrialization
and globalization combined.  We are not prepared for this, and it will
need to be addressed as quickly and aggressively as possible if we are
to avoid a repeat of the two world wars.



* Living outside of Earth's Biosphere

For us to survive outside of earth we must bring an
atmosphere/hydrosphere/biosphere with us.  The atmosphere that we
breath today was created over billions of years by life on the
planet.

We can survive for years, perhaps decades outside the planet by
bringing with us an atmosphere and liquid water.  But in all
likelyhood we will eventually die without a functional biosphere to
support enough biodiversity to produce a health atmosphere, and the
food, we need from plants, animals and micro organisms.  We are
complex creatures that live in an extremely varied and complex
interdependent ecosystem.  We won't survive as a species unless we can
replicate an earth-like biosphere outside of the planet.

Life on earth began in the oceans -- and all land creatures are still,
deep down, largely ocean creatures that learned to walk, crawl or fly
and breath.

We are just starting to understand how the oceans work, and we are
still far from understanding the relationship between land and marine
environments.

It's likely that we will not be successful in recreating our
terrestrial biosphere without a corresponding marine biosphere that is
far larger than the terrestrial space.  So, yes, bringing the ocean
with us to mars will not just be for people who enjoy beaches and
eating fish.   It's likely that it will determine our long term
survival or not.

* Why is all of this important

Everything we are and ever will be is determined by our relationship
to the biosphere and the climate that the biosphere maintains.

* Transactive Man

Homo Sapiens is a transactive species, we lived in small groups called
bands and we divide knowledge and skills between members of the band
into specialties.  Man is not the only transactive species.
Transaction is found in a wide variety of species.  The original
specialization which is seen across most of the living world is the
divide between sexes.  The fact that half of a species can reproduce
and the other can only fertilize set the stage for man to evolve and
take trasaction to a new level.

The difference is that specialization in all creatures but man over
evolutionary time scales and was ingrained in the dna of the spieces
as behaviors.  There was a very hard limit to the amount that an
individual could learn on its own beyond what was hardwired into its
genes.

Man was already a tool builder, but the tools developed stayed the
same for hundreds of thousands of years with little change.  Man is
not the only species that builds tool, but again our first tools were
little more than more sophisticated versions of what other primates
used for tools.

The development of the neocortex in homo sapiens changed that, by
extending the primitive core parts of the brain with general purpose
pattern matching and memory that gave man the ability to learn to
adapt to their environment within a lifetime or at least a generation
or two.

The neocortex can be thought of as an extention of the brain, but that
extension didn't stop there.

Tools are an extension of our physical limbs, allowing us to extend
and amplify what we do far beyond the limits of our senses and
physical bodies.

Perhaps this is where we will go into Jared Diamond's theory about why
different peoples advanced and others didn't.  His answer is that it
depended on access to domesticated animals, a handful of domesticated
plants and if you were lucky enough to live in a river valley.

And this is where we stop talking about man as a species and mankind
as a larger concept that includes all of those domesticated animals,
plants, insects (the bee for instance) as well as animals like the
dog.  This is a broad definition of mankind and it will soon will have
to be expanded to include AI.  Mankind is a holon, man is just the
creature at the center who thinks he's calling the shots.


Spoken language was the next great leap.  Spoken language made it
possible to dramatically expand our ability to specialize and
communicate with each other.  It also established the oral tradition
(Havelock) which created a group encyclopedia of all a groups knowlege
that was passed on from generation to generation through song and
stories.  This maxed out around the time of Plato -- and corresponded
roughly with the invention of writing systems.

The ancient Greeks were the transitional stage between the oral and
the beginning of a written tradition that transformed civilization
from being pockets of tight-knit settlements into the first states.

Writing made a number of things possible -- it extended our ability to
think and reason, by externalizing short term memory as we worked out
problems over hours, days, years or even generations.

Writing is a form of time travel, allowing one to send messages to the
future and to places you will never see to people you will never meet.

Perhaps the most astonishing thing about spoken language, writing and
symbol systems is that it separated information from our brains.
Spoken language allowed us to more precisely share memories and
experiences so that a band would have an oral store of information
that was an extremely powerful survival skill.  But oral traditions
drift over time.  Memories become stories, stories become legands and
legands begin to dissolve into the myths.  Until writing systems were
invented there was no history.  History, is literally, what was
written.  There is no history before writing.  Many people don't
understand that history is not what happened in the past, but a record
of what was recorded in the past.

Information could now flow independent of people -- and information
took the form of not only writing, but currencies, that made trade far
more flexible, by using tokens that were made of something precious
(metals in most cases).

Permanent structures also transformed the territorial geographic areas
controlled by different groups into property.  It's no accident that
we use the same word for things we own, and for land under someone's
control.  It's a common belief that indigenious peoples did not
believe in land ownership -- which is only partly true -- but they
very much controlled territories collectively and would kill any
stranger who ventured in their territory.  The concept of land as
property, not territory was an advancement in that it made land an
abstract concept that could be marked off, mapped and controlled by
rules and laws rather than automaticically murdering anyone found in
the wrong place.  This layed the groundwork for travel and commerce
between different groups which was not possible before.  This whole
concept has now been taken to its logical limit, with land, within a
territory to be absolutely owned by the political power in control
forever -- this is now starting to hurt us more than it helps, it's
outlived its usefulness and is now stopping the migration of people
around the planet.  This is one of the biggest problems that we face
today -- and unless we can let go of the silliness of sovereignty as a
divine right -- we will face serious problems.  Borders are lines
painted on maps and signposts -- they are not real.  Treating them as
such divides us -- letting a handful of people control those borders
and the resources in the way we do today is not sustainable.

This is where legibility and the state sneaks into our story

It also set down oral traditions into external storage which help
synchronize those traditions over large geographic areas.  This helped
establish nations.  Writing systems were only used by a very small
percentage of the population for the next 2,000 years.


* Civilization

Civilization emerged from a long interglacial period that has been
extremely stable, and mild.  This clemant climatic period made it
possible for man to stop wandering the earth following the food.  We
gradually learned to cultivate plants and begin to domesticate
animals, but we didn't yet know how to keep the same land fertile over
many years.  So man ended up settling in a handful of river valleys
where we improved our agricultural techniques and learned to build
permanent strucutures.  The city was born, and with it, the wealth and
safety for a percentage of the population to spend their time
innovating -- in other word, civilizization.
