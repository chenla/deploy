We start with the basic unit being a planetary body.  Not just planets
but planetiods including moons and large asteroids suitible for
building habitats.

* Structure of the Earth

Earth has a core which is broken down into an inner core of solid
iron that gives the planet it's magnetic field (important for
sheilding life from solar and cosmic radiation) which is surrounded by
a molten core, which is surrounded by a semi stable mantle which makes
up the bulk of the planet's mass.  The mantle has a more stable upper
mantle which is then surrounded by a thin crust.  The more stable part
of the upper mantle and the crust are what we live on and are made up
of tectonic plates that move over time and rearrange the continents
and oceans.  This is known as the lithosphere.

Above the Lithosphere is the hydrosphere, which inludes all water in
the oceans and any water vapour in the atmosphere.  Above the
lithosphere is the atmosphere which is the razor thin mixture of
mostly nitrogen and 20% oxygen (and trace elements) what we live in.

Finally, the biosphere is the region between the bottom of the
hydrosphere and the bottom part of the atmosphere that can sustain
life.

It's easy to forget how small the atmosphere and hydrosphere is
relative to the size of the planet.

* Biosphere




* Living outside of Earth's Biosphere

For us to survive outside of earth we must bring an
atmosphere/hydrosphere/biosphere with us.  The atmosphere that we
breath today was created over billions of years by life on the
planet.

We can survive for years, perhaps decades outside the planet by
bringing with us an atmosphere and liquid water.  But in all
likelyhood we will eventually die without a functional biosphere to
support enough biodiversity to produce a health atmosphere, and the
food, we need from plants, animals and micro organisms.  We are
complex creatures that live in an extremely varied and complex
interdependent ecosystem.  We won't survive as a species unless we can
replicate an earth-like biosphere outside of the planet.
