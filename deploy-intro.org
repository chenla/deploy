* Introduction

The Yellow Brick Road -- The Chenla Manifesto

  - scattershot; falling apart
   
    it's not the end of the world, it never was, and it
    arguably won't be for at least a couple of billion years
    more when the sun begins to run out of fuel and begins
    to expand as it cools as it transitions into it's next
    incarnation as a Red Giant.  In the process the earth's
    atmosphere will first boil away, and eventually the
    barren lifeless rock that is left will eventually be
    engulfed and will be no more

    the world doesn't need us, we, even as a species has
    existed such a short time that the world could not have
    noticed.  And the damage that we have done to the
    biosphere, might well be the end of our civilization and
    any future as an industrial technological species, will
    correct it self over thousands of years before anything
    watching on a planetary geological time scale would
    notice.

    we are not the center of any universe except the
    collective universe the world-model constructed by our
    brains.  Our universe, the one we think we are
    experiencing, literally only exists in our heads, an
    illusion that is made up up memories of what our senses
    have reported to our brains, and assembled using
    conjecture and hocus pocus into what we think we see.

  - it's not about you

  - getting a grip

    we need a mythological frame work that is woven through
    technology that gives us a means of keeping it all in
    our heads in a way that we can use it, and not get lost.

    we don't need to invent, so much as pick out what we
    already have and repurpose it, just as relgions have
    done -- we need to understand that technology is magic
    in a very real way -- that we don't see it as magic is
    why we feel so lost, man has always created their own
    gods, in their own images, the gods depend on us for
    their existence even as they take on lives of their own
    and do things on our behalf, though most of us have
    always gotten that backwards -- 

    this has to happen because we have splintered into so
    many specializations that no one can see how it all fits
    together any longer -- we have to trust that those who
    are responsible for each of the myriad specialties that
    make up our industrial technological civilization knows
    what they are doing, though none us thinks we, ourselves
    know what we're doing.





the stakes are enormous -- every civilization has, in the
end has ultimately collapsed because we as a species has
exceeded the carrying capacity of the biotope that is it's
home which has resulted in climate change that triggered a
collapse.  Population, war, disease, it all amounts to the
same thing.  We have repeatedly and consistently pushed the
carrying capacity of where we live until we reach a tipping
point and then collapse.

The problem now is that we are a global civilization that no
longer is in a single biotope, or biome.  Our civilization
now encompasses the entire planet's biosphere.  There is no
recovery from a collapse of the entire biosphere.

A growing number of very smart people have come to the
conclusion that the only way to escape the Fermi Paradox is
for mankind to become a multi-planet species.  But it's not
that simple, and at the same time it will have to be far
bigger than that.  And what no one seems to understand is
that we can't just send a million people to mars as a backup
plan and call it a day.  A technological industrial
civilization can't be easily copied and moved to a another
planet.  Civilizations aren't assembled like an Ikea
bookcase.  Civilizations, and cities grow organically like a
forrest, from the ground, roots growing down, and shoots
growing up.  Every attempt to build cities from the top down
have failed miserably.  And if we try to not only build a
top down city on Mars, but whole ecological biotopes, biomes
and a biosphere that can support a human civilization it
will fail as well.

The existential threats we face will not stay behind on
earth, they will follow us like rats in the holds of ships
wherever we go.  We can not escape ourselves.  There is no
tabla rasa, no resetting the clock to year zero.  There are
no utopia's, or any paradise outside of our imaginations in
this world or any other.

   Add the challenges of that planet having a near vacuum
   for an atmosphere, with no magnetic field, or large moon
   and little to no nitrogen, which makes up the bulk of our
   atmosphere and is the foundation for all plant life on
   our planet.  Mars as oxygen, in the form of frozen water,
   but without nitrogen we will have some very real
   problems.

But let's set all of that aside for a moment and 

if we can't make it work here, we won't be able to make it
work there, or anywhere else.  Yes, we will need to go to
Mars, and spread out throughout the solar system.  And we
need to start now.  But in order to make that work, we need
to solve the problems we have created here at the same
time.  

It won't work there unless it works here as well.

  - technologically
  - economically
  - ecologically
  - socially

and we can't do that unless we first know where we came
from, who and what we are, where we are now, and where we
are going.

No one has even tried to put it all together and believe me
I've looked.  There have been a lot of brilliant people who
have figured out different pieces of the puzzle, but no one
has tried to put it all together in any way that will be
useful to begin building a new civilization and a new
future on top of the civilization that is crumbling beneath
our feet.

This can't be just a book and an uplifting TEDTalk.  It
needs to be something we start building, all of us,
everywhere.  It's can't be a movement, or lifestyle choice.
It /can not/ be an ideology, or another grand theoretical
abstraction like communism, or free market captialism or any
of a dozen or more /isms/.  It won't work if it means that
we have to choose to make sacrifices.  Without an immanent
existential threat /NO ONE/ chooses to sacrifice themselves
or their families and future unless there is something very
wrong with them.  But you can ask people to give up things
they have today in exchange for something better -- not
tomorrow or some unspecified time in the future -- but in a
time frame that people can feel comfortable with.

It has to be natural, comfortable and inevitable.  It has to
work for all of us or it won't work for any of us.

The great filter stands directly in front and ahead of us.
We are like mosquito larvae in a pool of cool clean water.
The surface is above us, and we know we must pass through,
but the surface tension makes that impossible.  We can not
pass through as we are now.  We must solve our problems and
transform, so that we can not only push through to the
surface but when we emerge it will be as something different
and hopefully better. But in all likelyhood it will be a
tradeoff.  A mosquito larvae, wriggling in the water below,
transforms to become bumbling flying bloodsuckers.  There
are no guarantees, but if there is survival, there is hope.
And perhaps we will, as Abraham Lincoln said, listen to the
nature of our better angels and leave the world a better
place when we leave it.


** Preamble

#+begin_quote
The tough part of the exercise, I will tell you -- and
again, this is derivative of my training as a trial lawyer
-- is the limited capacity -- it's pretty big but it's
limited -- capacity of the human mind to retain information.
There's an analogy that one of my mentors used to presenting
evidence to a jury.  He would say it's sort of like pouring
coffee into a cup and saucer.  You can keep pouring facts in
and they may all be facts and they may be all proven and
everything else, but if you pour too much, eventually the
coffee's going to spill onto the saucer and the trial lawyer
never knows what remains in the cup of that juror's mind.

   Connection]] | Moyers & Company, 2017
#+end_quote

And this, I would say, is the greatest challenge, not only
for myself, but for the audience.  I have spent nearly my
whole adult life working on this.  There have been some
detours, but not as many as you might think.  I can trace
where I am now back to a couple of weeks in 1978, sitting at
a typewriter and catching the glimpse of something that has
never let me go.  And the challange was first to figure out
what it was and second how to get it all down so others
could understand as well.

I know that the way to do this is to just start anywhere and
start putting things out piece by piece until it's all
there.  But it takes time to fill a cup, and people won't
understand how it all fits together and there is no way of
knowing what will still be people's cup when it's finished.

So six months ago I set out to write a simple outline, the
big picture, the ten thousand foot perspective.  Ok, it
would never be an elevator pitch, but at least it would be
something that could be read in a single sitting.  That
effort resulted in drafts and notes that number something
like half a million words that was trying to summerize all
the work done over the past 39 years.

So here I stand today, ready to take that first step towards
a short overview.  This is /not/ that overview.  So think
of what you read next, as sort of the map of the map of what
we are trying to build.

Ya gotta start /somewhere/, so here we go...

** Greased Pig Text

As a high school student in the 1970's I had been reading a
lot of big heavy novels like Thomas Pynchon's /Gravity's
Rainbow/ which defies summarization.  GR is one of a handful
of texts that include works like /Moby Dick/, Joyce's
/Ulysses/ that are known as encyclopedic narratives.  These
works are vast, complex and and can almost be considered to
be self-contained worlds in them selves.  I was facinated
with these works because you couldn't take them straight on,
because all you'd see is the trees, not the forest.  This
was both facinating and frustrating until, in 1978 I hit on
the idea of a /greased pig text/ -- something small, fast,
heavy, and impossible to get hold of.  It's the idea of a
text as a kind of horizon, something you can see, but never
reach.

A greased-pig text is a bit like Plato's cave, except the
shadows on the wall are not cast by a world of forms, but
just the real world, which is so complex that it's beyond
our ability to take it all in.  The shadows we take for the
real world are a map built up over our lives by our brains,
an amalgam of memory, inferrence, and what we are
experiencing from moment to moment.  At best we can hope, as
individuals to glimpse bits of the real world at the
periphery of our vision.  Perhaps that comes across as
pessimistic and yes, that's what we are stuck with as
individuals.  But we aren't just individuals.  We are a
transactive species, who divide our memory and cognition
with others, enabling us to each difference glimpses of
the larger puzzle and then share, compare and build a model
of what we collectively have experienced.

The story of our species is the story of externalization of
mind, memory and muscle.  This began with the hippocampus
which extended our core reptilian brain, which gave us
emotion, fear and a whole lot of motivation.  Later mammals
developed a neocortex which can be thought of as a sort of
general purpose pattern matching engine that could program
itself.  

Like a handful of other animals, Man is a tool builder.
Combined with the ability to learn and change our behavior
tools evolved to extend and transcend the limits of how our
senses and limbs could be used to adapt the world around us.

It was likely sometime at that point that we began to
externalize and extend our minds.  This first happened with
the development of speech and eventually writing systems.
This allowed us to communicate and record all of those
little glimpses not just with each other in real time, but
across time and space to others who had not yet been born.

Our genius as a species is collectively to be greater than
the sum of a bunch of clever apes.  Up until the middle of
the 20th century it was still concievable for individuals to
at least grasp the big picture of all human knowledge and
history (which is not what had happened, but what had been
written).  You can't know where you are or where you are
going unless you know where you you came from.  And Mankind
has now built up a map made of so many glimpses that the
totality of what we have learned of our selves and the
world exceeds our ability to grasp as individuals what we
know collectively.

And this is the motivation that has driven us to keep
extending and externalizing ourselves to turn tools into
machineswhich are connected to external power sources.
We started by harnessing domesticated animals and wind and
eventually steam and petrochemicals to generate
electricity.  Our machines and externalized collective
memory has become more complex and abstract and at each
stage becoming closer and closer to becoming complete
externalizations of ourselves both in mind and body.

Electricity not only powered machines, and replaced fire for
lighting the darkness, it was soon harnessed to help us
think, remember and communicate.  And so came electronics,
telecommunications, analog and then digital storage as well
as cognitive machines that, like our neocortex, are general
purpose programmable machines.  Combine a machine and a
computer and you get a robot.  Teach computers how to learn
and you get AI.  There is no end game, and the AI we build
is ultimately us, it is build to externalize and extend
oursleves to do things our bodies and minds are not capable
of.  Some machines will eventually become intelligent on
their own, but we will have externalized and extended
ourselves at the same rate.  So it's likely that the
machines will not take over as they exponentially get
smarter because we'll be there with them at each stage.
This doesn't diminish the dangers.  In many respects it's a
lot more scary to think of a primate that is still basically
designed for life on the African savannah to have that kind
of amplified intelligence and muscle.  In the end, it's
likely the nothing will change.  Man will always be the
greatest threat to itself.


** The Great Filter

It's likely that the next 50 years will be what scientists
call Mankind's /Great Filter/ that will determine if we
continue on, or die as a technological species.  This is at
the heart of Fermi's Paradox, which asks why we haven't
found evidence of other intelligent life in the universe.
You see the question pop up over and over when talking to
scientists in a wide range of disciplines because it's not
about other species, it's about us.  Once you are looking
for it, it is everywhere in science, from the Doomsday
Clock that was established by scientists during the heat of
the atomic cold war, to the bleak warnings from people like
Steven Hawking.

Is the reason we haven't found any one else out there
because when a species builds a technological civiliztion it
becomes unstable and destroys itself?

It's that fear, that keeps a lot of scientists awake at
night.  And this is not some abstract fear of the sun
burning out a couple of billion years from now consumes the
sun as it expands as it cools.  We're talking about
existential end of our species as a technological
civilization within a lifetime.

The thermonuclear sword of damocles was bad enough, but at
least it was simple.  Mutual Assured Destruction (MAD) was
the pinnacle existential threats, even a child could grasp
it.  But that has been replaced by threats which are beyond
our ability to internalize.  We have screwed up
extreamly complex and slow moving climatic systems that make
not just human, but all life possible and this is because
our population has not just excceded the carrying capacity
of a single biome, which has happened in the past and was
responsible at least indirectly for the collapse of nearly
every civilization in the past.  But this time, we have only
a single global civilization which has exceeded the carrying
capacity of the entire planet's biosphere.  There are too
many of us packed into a single place.  That is not only a
problem with the climate, it will inevitably lead to
pandemics which, when reaching mega-cities will catch fire
like a match to a pool of gasoline.  We still have the
nuclear sword hanging over our heads -- perhaps no longer by
a single hair of a horse tail, but maybe a sturdier piece of
twine, that could still be easily severed.

** Jellybeans

As JRR Martin wrote, we are all jelly beans, all pretty
colors on the outside and the same sugary crap on the
inside.  There are no races, if you can fuck it and make a
baby, you are both members of the same race. It needs to be
said that crudely because deep down we all have been raised
to believe that there are fundemental differences between
us.  There aren't.  The differences are genetically no more
different than the difference between dressing business
casual or formal.  And cultural differences are just as
shallow.  We tend to hate those who are closer to us than
those who are further apart.  The clash between Chrisitanity
and Islam is the difference between two books which both
proclaim a montheistic model of the universe based on the
words of a single mouthpiece of an single omniscient god,
everything else is just differences in style, the basic plot
is the same.  Again, culture is all jellybeans.  The real
differences between us are determined by the level of
economic development a culture happends to be in relative
to another.

#+begin_aside
When I lived in Beijing in 2001, Chinese middle class
culture was closer to American culture in the 1950's than
anyone in the West understood.  The attitude towards family,
work, education, even the men smoking and drinking congac
while the wives minded the children and look pretty wearing 
heels, with a string of perls and their best posh frock was
straight out of an episode of Man Men. I remember seeing
over fifty couples ballroom dancing in a vacant dirt lot.
As the light faded, all you could see was the silhouettes of
each couple, as the girls skirts billowed as they spun
silently in the darkness.

The Chinese middle class had emerged from a long period that
was similar in impact as the Great Depression and the Second
World War in the United States.  And the State was still
somewhat crudely weilding a big stick and fear of outside
enemies and the danger of it all falling apart.  I have seen
the same pattern again and again in every country I have
lived in.  It's all profoundly human and the same.  We're
all jellybeans.
#+end_aside

When cultures clash it is more often than not because one
culture sees the world from a perspective that had been the
norm for the contrasting culture in a past time.  But this
fact is lost in distraction of pretty colors of language,
costume, cultural mythology, the shade and hue of one's
skin, the shape of your nose and eyes, or the color of your
hair.  Underneath we're all made of the same sugary crap.

It should be obvious why I am saying all of this, but let's
say it anyway.  We are now all next door neighbors.  What
happens in Doha plays out in real time on big screens in
every living room in Barstow, and on every little screen in
every pocket of every preson even slighly above the poverty
line from Patterson to Phnom Penh.  The food we eat, the
clothes we wear, the brands we crave are all a part of an
interdependent global value chain.  It's too late to protest
globalisation, it is now the fabric of the single global
civilization which we are all part of.  Whether we like it
or not we're all in this together so we might as well cut
the bullshit and learn to get along.  It's time to put away
childish things.  We have no choice.  The alternative
is... there is no alternative.  We do or die.  This won't
happen overnight.  But it will have to happen over the next
few generations, and to do that each of us has to swallow
some very bitter pills.  We are too old to change, but we
can at least aspire to what Abraham Lincoln called "the
better angels of our nature" and allow our children to grow
beyond our absurd prejudices, ignorance, ideologies, and
belief systems so each generation can learn from the past
and expect that their children will live in a better world
than themselves.

** steering a course 

All of this may sound absurdly utopian, or idealisitc or an
unreasonable thing to ask people to do.  But it's not.  It
is pragmatic, and will make your life materially, physically
and spiritually better.  This is not some inspirational
TEDTalk, it's not something that you'll see in the self-help
section of the bookstore.  It's not some group to join,
ideology to adopt, church to sell your soul to, or flag to
bind your allegiance to. It /will/ be a tradeoff.  You give
up some things and gain much more than you give up.  It will
simply be a good way to live as mankind moves beyond
globalism into a world awash with artificial intelligence,
robotics, and genetic editing.

We will soon live in a post-fossil-fuel economy where solar,
wind, and geothermal will be the furniture in the room and
/everything/ will not only be electric but smart and
networked together. The big players will either be gone or
so radically transformed that they won't be recognizable as
the companies we know today as we move from today's
centralized electrical grid, cloud computing, industrialized
agriculture and nation states.  John Gage famously in the
1990's "the network is the computer."  Soon, the network
will be the logistic chain, the monetary system, and most
things that we now consider to be functions of the State.
We will move from a small tier of decentralised
multinational globalized company-base value-chains to a
distributed world where many of the things that are
centralized or globalized at large scales today will become
localized in a very very fine-grained global network of
information, currency, goods and services.

In his 2016 book /The Inevitable/, Kevin Kelly breatlessly
outlined 12 major technological forces that will reshape the
world in the next decades.  His argument is that each of
these forces are inevitable, they will happen no matter what
we do.  But the form that they take is not known.  For
example, the Internet was inevitable, but it was not
inevitable that the internet we have today was inevitable.
The internet today could have been an outgrowth of a
centralised network like France's Minitel.  Smart Phones
were inevitable, but it was not inevitable that they would
all be modeled after the iPhone and the App ecosystem that
runs on it.

I am not trying to predict the future, though part of what I
am doing is like Kevin Kelly, to determine what the
inevitable trends we will have to live with over the next 50
years.  But it's not enough to ride the winds, because winds
change and not always in the direction you want to go in.
Rather we need to listen to Alan Kay when he said "the best
way to predict the future is to invent it."

So here's the plan.  First figure out how we got where we
are today and understand the forces that shaped who we are
and determined both our strengths and weaknesses.  Next work
out the inevitable forces that will shape the next fifty
years that includes everything from climate change to solar
energy, CRISPR babies, self-driving cars and the looming
shadow of artificial intelligence as either good or bad.
Third, we define what we individually and collectively can
agree on being the absolute essential requirements to live a
good life that ensures transparency, accountabiliy, privacy
and safety while guaranteeing everyone a base standard of
healthcare, education, and the basics defined in the base
levels of Maslow's /hierarchy of needs/.

Fourth, we take all of this and map out the broad outline of
a future that is distributed, socially and economically
egalitarian, and sustainable (though I prefer the stronger term
/antifragile/).

And finally, fifth, we will provide a framework for beginning
to develop, build and deploy this in the real world.  As
we learn more from both success and failures we can then go
back and adjust our models and expectations set out in the
first four steps.  Wash, Rinse, Repeat until we have made a
better world.

We will start laying out the story, argument and plan in
detail here over the coming months and years.  And we will
begin spinning off projects, experiments and even companies
which will work on and provide services and solutions.

Any plan today is better than a perfect plan tomorrow.  So
let's start building something....

* 1: in the beginning
** drake and fermi

What is it that determines what we are and what and how we
can do things?

Drake's Equation and the Fermi Paradox keep a lot of
scientists, in a wide range of disciplines, awake at night.
These are not academic questions, they are at the heart of
understanding both our existence and our survival.

This is a good place to start -- because the answers
determine everything.

The number of such civilizations {{mvar|N}}, is assumed to be equal to the mathematical product of

** the rest

 - Physics
   - matter, energy, time
   - gravity -- keeps stuff in place, makes many biological
     processes easier -- no need for many pumps -- all life
     evolved in a gravity well -- but not terrestrially --
     all land animals still have a lot of biological
     heritage from our origins in the oceans -- and buoyancy
     (add to that bouyancy salt) partially counters gravity
     -- so we may yet find that we are better adapted to low
     gravity environments than we think.... freefall is
     another story.  there is no question that we are not
     designed for freefall.
   - entropy -- and the arrow of time
   - speed limits
     - changes propagate -- information propagates
     - allows us to see into the past
     - pace layers different things change at different speeds 
   - stability of elements -- carbon is very important
 - Galaxies create stellar nurseries, and keep enough stars
   together so that intelligent species will know they are
   not alone.  Too close together is dangerous, too far
   apart will make intersteller travel impractical (it's not
   clear if our neighbors are too far away or not).
 - Stars
   - create heat and light, which makes many things possible
   - a gravity well that allows things to stay close to the
     heat in a stable manner
 - Planets
   - structure - core, mantle, crust
   - size -- small and rocky -- too heavy and it will be too
     difficult to escape the gravity well  
   - 4 spheres, litho, hydro, atmo, bio
 - Biospheres

   - The Earth's biosphere is a lot smaller than you might
     think.  71% of the earth's biosphere is in the oceans
     -- and only a relatively thin depth of the oceans holds
     99% (that's a guess) of the life in the oceans.  I
     would then say that only a thin part of the earth's
     atmosphere holds 99% of terrestrial life as well.  So
     effectively all of life on the planet resides in in
     less than 2-5% of the planet's biosphere. I need to
     back this up with real sources and figures.

   - DNA -- self-replicating information systems
     life and evolution is the result of DNA making copies
     of itself and changing over time as errors (mutations)
     are introduced from copying errors -- some changes
     improve the chances of DNA of being able to replicate
     itself and thus better able to survive.
   - Environment -- temperature, pressure, fuel sources
     (chemical and solar) gravity, elements
   - biosphere --> biome --> biotope --> species
   - Carrying Capacity
   - Minimal Viability
   - Extinction events: clean house and prepare for
     explosive growth

 - Transactive species 

   this was a major breakthrough, by taking a group of
   individuals and dividing tasks requiring memory, muscle
   and cognition between different members of a group -- the
   original specialization is male and female.

 - brain evolution

   brains evolved over time by wrapping themselves in more
   advanced brains.  Most animals have brains which are
   essentially hardwired 

   the neocortex is a general purpose computer that can
   reprogram itself -- capable of doing things in hours,
   days, and years that used to require many generations of
   natural selection to achieve

   the evolution of the brain is the story of the brain
   extending itself.  But homosapians, have grown such a
   large brain that it now effects childbirth, not only
   making it painful, but more dangerous.

 - externalization

   since we can't grow our brains any larger, our neocortex
   did something remarkable -- it figured out how to
   leverage our transactional nature to externalize brain
   capacity - to move memory, cognition and muscle outside
   of our bodies and into the group

 - tools

   man is not the only tool building species, but there we
   are the first to be able to innovate in timescales of
   individuals. 

   the whole opposable thumb thing is important -- 

 - speech

   the development of spoken languages was an astonishing
   innovation that made it possible to offload memory to
   other people in a group -- language made it possible to
   standardize labels for things, so that we could share our
   thoughts in detail.  It made it possible to store
   information in human memory across a group and pass those
   memories from generation to generation.  this made
   possible the birth of agriculture, abstract thinking, and
   civilization -- but it hit a wall sometime around the
   time of the age of Homer.  Havelock....

   speech made cities possible

   money was physical wealth that could be used for trading
   

 - writing systems

   the invention of writing systems allowed man to extend
   speech in a number of important ways.  
 
   time travel, space travel, independent of human memory
   storage.

   writing was limited to a very small part of the
   population -- which was enough to make states

 - duplication

   the printing press made exact copies possible

   the printing press expanded literacy to populations at
   large which was needed for the industrial revolution.

   money started to become symbolic, backed by threat of
   phsyical power and eventually stopped being backed by
   physical wealth, only threat of force

 - machines 

   machines are complex tools that combine multiple tools
   into a larger tool -- when machines are connected to an
   external power supply (not human) which could be an
   animal, water or wind powered -- the machine can perform
   complex tasks with little or no human guidance.

   steam (and later diesel and then electricity)

 - computers

   for our purposes here, a computer is a combination of
   both memory, computation and executable code

 - networks

   linked computers together in the same way that speech and
   writing linked people together

   money became information

 - robotics 

   a combination of machines and computers -- when software
   becomes complex enough it becomes increasingly autonomous
   and can do things independently of human control or even
   direction

* 2: civilization

Now let's back up and talk about civilization.

** wanderers

In the beginning, man wasn't much different from other
creatures on the savannah, following the food.  Sure, humans
could build rudimentary tools, clothing and shelter and
eventually learned to harness fire.  But they still needed
to move to new locations as game moved, and edible crops
were exhausted.

Groups were small, and spread out.  Man as a species was
highly distributed, and because of their tools, clothing,
shelters and fire they were able to move into climates that
would have killed them otherwise.  They were able to extend
the the range of habitible biomes, and in a relatively short
period of time had spread out to most corners of the planet.

** farms and cities

Untill recently it was thought that the invention of
cultivating plants quickly led to the development of the
first cities.  But a growing body of archeological evidence
indicates that agriculture had been invented as long as
45kyr.  Man still wandered, but the wandering slowed, as
they learned to stay in a location long enough to grow and
harvest food.  But this still wasn't enough to establish
permanent settlements as a few years of growing crops in the
same location would exhaust the soil.  And man still hadn't
domesticated animals to the point where they could give up
hunting wild game.

Three things changed this -- the domestication of animals for
food, and the knowledge of how to breed them.  And the
domestication of other animals that could be used for
transportation and work, and the discovery that growing
crops in river valleys was largely sustainable because
rivers brought sediments from upstream that replentished
nutriants in the soil every year.  The first great
civilizations were all located in river valleys in parts of
the world where a handful of animal species were suitible
for domestication.

Much later, cities emerged in non-river-valley locations in
the tropics and subtropics that did not rely on annuals for
all of their food supplies.  They grew annuals, but relied
on food from perennials as much or more than annuals.
Fruits, nuts and legumes were typically far more nutritious
and could be harvested sustainably for decades without
replanting.  When compared to annuals which had to be
planted every year, seeds collected at harvest for the next
year and would quickly exhaust the soil after a couple of
years.

It took a long time to learn techniques such as crop
rotation, leaving fields fallow and how compost, green
manure and animal manure could be used to recharge soils.
Many of the techniques for doing this were very sustainable
but at a cost.  These techniques were highly labour
intensive, even with the help of domesticated animals.  The
emergence of monoculture farming techniques, mechanization,
and the development of nitrogen-based chemical fertilizers
and later chemical herbicides and pesticides were all means
of attempts to reduce labour and increase crop yields to
feed the ever growing population of non-agricultural
populations in cities.  It should be noted that expanding
cultivated land using annuals is far faster than it takes
for perennials to begin producing food.  As populations
relentlessly outpaced the carrying capacity of agricultural
yields, it is no wonder that man become increasingly
dependent on annuals.

Power struggles emerged over who controlled the food supply.
Cities could muster and place large numbers of people under
arms in ways that a dispersed rural agricultural population
could not.  This was used to control rural populations who
were actually the ones producing the wealth and force them
give up their wealth for little or nothing to feed the
armies that kept them under control.  Farmers could not
muster the numbers needed to protect themselves from the
cities and became little more than slaves.  This is still
largely the case.  Weapons and armies have been replaced by
banks and corporations located in the cities, but the
corporations are still backed by the state which enforces
it's sovereignty with the threat of physical force.

It's interesting to note that a number of these
civilizations did not have access to species that could be
domesticated, which limited how far they could expand.
Human powered transport was a very real limiting factor both
on how far and how fast information could travel.  On land,
animals were the only means of extending the physical limits
of the human body.

Rivers and access to seas and oceans were another important
means of increasing the speed of transportation by
harnessing the wind as well as human powered ores.  Not
surprisingly, most civilizations emerged along water ways,
with the notable exception of central and south americas.

It is here that we can begin to understand civilization
using three metrics, the difficulty or cost of moving
physical goods, the cost of moving information, and the cost
of moving people.

These three things comprise the economic foundation for
civilization and how far it can expand beyond stand alone
cities surrounded by smaller settlements.

However, it should be noted that farms and cities are
interdependent.  Cities provide people who specialize in
things that farms depend on.  Farming is extremely labor
intensive.  There is not time to farm, mine iron ore, smelt
it and turn it into ploughshares.  The same goes for
production of pottery, glass, textiles (which is as labour
intensive as food production) etc.  

Is it possible for a farm to be completely self-sustainable?
For food, yes.  For everything else?  No. A group of farms
could barely do so, if each farm used a portion of their
spare time to specialize in producing one or two items.  But
as soon as you do that you have set the wheels in motion to
establish a village that has a dedicated blacksmith, cooper,
candleshop, potter, glass blower, baker.... and before you
know it you have the makings of a town and governance and
the village shaman now has to take on helpers which turn
into religions and not long after you have a city.

All of the post-apocolyptic survivalist prepper wet dreams
are built on a stockpile of items that requires an entire
industrial civilization to produce using a large number of
specialties and the infrastructure, access to resources and
wealth required to support all of those specialists without
them having to grow food.  Can a family do all of this
themselves?  For a while, but over time, as the stockpile
swindles and there is little or no free time to do labor
intensive things like mine and produce iron, after a couple
of generations (depending on the stockpile) the family will
degrade back to what we were before the first cities.  The
stockpile of knifes, axes, needles, pots and pans will not
last forever, no matter how much recyling of metal you do.

Again, it keeps coming back to our transactive nature.  We
literally live or die collectively.  And thriving is
directly proportionate to how well we can do things
together.

Which came first -- the farm or the city?  Neither, they
emerged together and have always depended on each other.  

A small band of people with weapons and portable shelters
can go it alone.  But there is no farm without the
infrastructure and protection of a state, and states are
organized around settlements.  A settlement is a farm-city
in miniature -- but as populations in settlements rose, an
increasingly number of specializations moved agricultural
production to the edges of settlements and increasingly
further afield, so to speak.  The non-agricultural part of
the settlement became increasingly estranged from nature and
became cities.  The original settlement that encompased farm
and city grew to become the first states.

  - settlement (agriculture and non-agriculture)
  - city-state -- muang with overlapping sovereignty

- goods could be moved over long distances by water routes,
  but without the technology for long distance navigation
  (the longitude problem) and a reliable power source that
  could augement human power (rowing) and wind (sails) there
  was very real limits on how many goods could be moved.
  The goods that were moved (at great expence and in small
  quantities) were invaluable to the ruling class to be able
  to maintain their populations.  Books, compasses,
  navigation devices such as the sextant and later, portable
  clocks and telescopes.  these technologies didn't impact
  the average person, but they made large scale governance
  of large settlements and states possible.

- writing systems -- messaging over long distances (news),
  recording knowledge across generations and long distances

- mechanical duplication -- printing press, made accurate exact
  copies of information to a group of people outside of the
  state, church and academia.

This made moving information, people and goods relatively
cheap for the ruling class -- which was enough to transform
civilizations and lay the foundations for expansion to the
population at large in the industrial revolution.

** industrialization

In many respects, it's astonishing how far man was able to
go before tools evolved into machines, making
industrialization possible.

But the limitations of the system were very much apparent --
a number of civilizations rose and thrived for centuries,
only to hit the limits that their technology could expand
their carrying capacity and then collapsed -- often within
very short periods of time.

The limits they came up against, again were the cost of
moving people, information and goods.  

As Gibson said, the future is here, it's just not evenly
distributed.  Industrialization was possible because things
like literacy, which had been limited to the ruling classes
spread to a large part of the population after Gutenberg's
printing press.

This not only put books into the hands of many more people,
which increased literacy, but made accurate duplication of
texts possible.  Industrialization requires moving a lot of
information.  Hand copying of texts is not only slow, but
introduce errors which are compounded with each successive
copy.  Printing presses using moveable type allowed accurate
copies to created once and sent to many places.  This made
standardization possible.

 - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mueang][Mueang]] | Wikipedia

The modern concept of the state as territories with clearly
defined sub-meter immutable borders is quite recent in much
of the world.  In southeast asia these concepts were
introduced by Europpeans in the middle of the 19th-century
who assumed that every area was "subject to one sovereign."


#+begin_quote
The role of cartography in the formation of modern states is
made evident when depictions in maps are compared against
actual boundary practices and the language of peace
treaties. Clear linear divisions between territorial
political units, while pervading maps since the sixteenth
century, did not become common in practice until late in
the eighteenth century. For their part, mapmakers never
intended to reshape political ideas and structures. Rather,
their choice to depict the world as composed of homogenous
political territories was independent of politics.  It was
driven by the dual incentives of a commercial market for
aesthetically pleasing printed maps and the underlying
geometric structure of early-modern cartography that is
provided by the globe-spanning grid of latitude and
longitude.

#+end_quote



The sovereignty of nation-states only exists through threat
of physical force and the recognition of state sovereignty
by other nation-states.

This provides us with a post nation-state model founded on
biomes and biotopes.  A muang could be a city at the center
of a biotope.  Muangs and Mandalas are defined by their
centers, not by their borders.  Every muang is responsible
for the welfare, saftey and infrastructure of the biotope.
When there is more than one muang in a biotope, that
responsibility is shared between them.  Large industrial
muang that encompass multiple biotopes and smaller muang are
responsible for the entire biome they belong to, and the
welfare and safety of the smaller muang and biotopes within
them.  Rural areas may be within the sphere of influence of
multiple muangs and mandalas

  - a muang must extend all services and support to the
    rural areas that they depend on for food etc.  If you
    are in a rural area that is overlapped by multiple
    muang, you get to choose which muang that you get, say,
    healthcare or any other service so long as this is
    evenly divided between muang.  For this to work, all
    overlapping muang must provide the same level of
    overlapping services -- so that there is, in theory, no
    difference in quality of service.  This will also
    require that muang help each other maintain the same
    levels of service within their own muangs.  In this way,
    neighbors are responsible for each other.

This model makes it possible establish a more flexible means
of dealing with human migration and base rules for people
moving into new locations to replace the concept of citizens
of nation-states:

  - each location will always have a buffer for accepting
    migrants, the deal is, that if there is space in the
    buffer (the carrying capacity of a muang and surrounding
    biotope) you can move in and have full access to rights
    and services of that place.

  - migrants are required to adhere to local customs, adopt
    local dress, culture and language so long as they adhere
    to a universal bill of rights and obligations.  this is
    a multi-generational process, but within two
    generations, the children of immigrants should be fully
    integrated into the local muangs.  so essentially this
    allows muangs to preserve their identities and culture,
    but does not create ethnic and genetic firewalls.

  - legibility.... names could be an important means of
    helping along with this process.  there are countless
    examples of groups changing their names as a means of
    integrating into a new home.  names divide us into us
    and them -- if you adopt local names, you will, after a
    generation or two, no longer be identifiable as other.
    we need to get away from the modern concept of names --
    especially family names.  the whole idea of family
    genealogy is historically recent.  and for all of this
    to work state legibility must be divorced from
    identification -- legibility is not something imposed
    and maintained by the state, but is defined and
    maintained as part of an individuals personal
    sovereignty.  Identity is just information describing
    overlapping roles -- so long as each role has a
    public-facing globally unique name that requires the
    owner of that role to be transparent and accountable for
    what is done in that role then the system should work,
    and all of us become a lot more portable.  When we move
    to a new muang, we establish a new role, and track
    record within that role.  Our previous roles fade into
    the past as you build up new relationships and
    credibility in your new home-role.

  - true names are seldom, if ever, shared, because it gives
    others power over us.  

The hard part of this model for many people will be
religion, which is too much of a divide between us and
them.  We need to move away from religion and nationality as
being cornerstones of personal identity.  Religion as a
social construct that is part of a culture, mythology and
language that forms a common world-view of a muang is
important.  But unless we can learn to let go of the
cultural specifics from where you came from, this will be
diffucult.  Separation of church and state does not work
unless citizens separate the two as well.  The mongols had
the right idea -- all religions are under the great blue
sky, so it didn't matter which one you belonged to.

* 3: roadmap

It's easy to get overwhelmed -- but I think the key to
glocalism comes down to our transactive nature.  When things
get too complex, break it down into multiple specialties --
a specialty represent a human, or software process.

Polyculture's two biggest challenges are complexity and
labor.  The amount of information and experience to manage
monocultures is not trivial -- a polyculture is
exponentially more complex.  There used to be a great deal
of local cultural knowledge for each biome that was passed
down from generation to generation.  That body of knowledge
is at the brink of being lost.  The second problem is
labor.  Permaculture systems actually mitigate this by
leveraging ecosystems to do the work that the farmers used
to do.  Let the animals and plants do the work for you.  But
this still leaves the problem of harvesting and aggregating
small amounts of many different crops in a commercially
viable way.

***  1,000 year business plans

I've struggled with the idea of very long term business
plans for some years.  The whole thing about them is that
they are not only beyond the lifespan of individuals but
even of languages, cultures and nations.

Shepard's idea of farms following natural seccession could
provide us with a way to do this:

#+begin_quote
Crop rotation for a perennial polyculture would follow the
natural successional pathway for the region where it is
being practiced and could take several thousand years. A
simple crop rotation for a restoration agriculture farmer
might begin with corn and would travel through the
successional pattern by morphing into chestnuts, apples (or
plums or cherries), and hazelnuts. By the 30th year
chestnuts would dominate the site, and apples and hazelnuts
would become the understory. Livestock would be present
through all the years. By year 100 or so, the system would
be dominated by chestnuts and the understory fruits and
hazelnuts would be beginning to decline in vigor, then quite
possibly (after a 1,000 years or so) the whole system could
be clear-cut to harvest the high-value timber and then
bulldozed to make way for corn, and the beginning of the
next crop rotation.

In many respects, such an approach takes people out of the
equation as being the primary focus, and instead man is an
agent that shapes and maintains a biotope to "follow the
natural successional pathway" over very long time periods.
In this scenario, man quite literally become ents -- /tree
herders/ who act on an ecological system over time.  We are
shaping the biotope to produce things that keep us alive,
but to do that we need to shepard whole ecosystems, both
wild and cultivated.  Because we need entire ecosystems in
order to survive.

If we are to succeed in terraforming mars, this is only
approach that we can take if we are to exceed.  We must
design and execute on scales that are beyond us.  But there
must be incremental payoffs that provide incentives along
the way.

Let's say that Musk can pull it off and put a couple of
thousand people on Mars who will then proceed to build a
settlement which will be little more than a research station
with a very poor quality of life.  After that is established
the next goal is to lay the groundwork for an okay quality
of life for the next million people coming to the planet.
But they will have to feel in their bones that what they are
building will give a real payoff in their children's
lifetimes and to make Mars into a permanent home for
mankind.

For a long time I thought the answer would be underground --
but I'm coming round to the idea of matryoshka domes over
craters.  These domes would be nested within each other.
At the center would be a dome that supported earth level
atmospheric pressure and a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere.  The
other layers above would be pressurized martian atmosphere
at a increasingly lower pressurization's at each layer.

As the planet is terraformed, heated and the atmosphere
thickened each layer can then be removed until finally the
last layer is removed when the outside and inside had
reached an equilibrium.

In the early centuries the flora and fauna in the domes
would be imports from earth, but over time they would adapt
to target conditions for the final terraformed planet.  We
would be sheparding ecosystems to adapt to the reality of a
habitable mars as much as we are terraforming the planet to
become habitable -- the result will not be earth, but it
will be a sister home for martian mankind.

So we will need to establish settlements almost from day one
at elevations that will not eventually become large bodies
of water.  I don't know how successful this will be.  Can we
really predict stable sea levels for a clement terraformed
mars a thousand or two thousand years from now?

The same approach will be used back on earth to correct the
damage done to the biosphere and bring the planet back into
a clement interglacial period that can last millions of
years.  This is not just a matter of cleaning up the present
mess we've made, but to become planetary shepards who
correct for long term climatic changes and catastrophies
such as asteriod hits and super volcanos.

And again, we will do this in large part by becoming Ents
and herding trees and managing natural ecological succession.

* Facts of Life

We really need to start at the big bang because it is what
establish the fundamental physical laws of the unverse.
This isn't abstract abstract shit -- it determines how and
what works and what doesn't.

 - gravity
 - entropy & thermodynamics
 - space, matter, energy, time

Models are maps in more than 2 dimensions

* The Rest


We start with the basic unit being a planetary body.  Not just planets
but planetiods including moons and large asteroids suitible for
building habitats.

* Structure of the Earth

Earth has a core which is broken down into an inner core of solid
iron that gives the planet it's magnetic field (important for
sheilding life from solar and cosmic radiation) which is surrounded by
a molten core, which is surrounded by a semi stable mantle which makes
up the bulk of the planet's mass.  The mantle has a more stable upper
mantle which is then surrounded by a thin crust.  The more stable part
of the upper mantle and the crust are what we live on and are made up
of tectonic plates that move over time and rearrange the continents
and oceans.  This is known as the lithosphere.

Above the Lithosphere is the hydrosphere, which inludes all water in
the oceans and any water vapour in the atmosphere.  Above the
lithosphere is the atmosphere which is the razor thin mixture of
mostly nitrogen and 20% oxygen (and trace elements) what we live in.

Finally, the biosphere is the region between the bottom of the
hydrosphere and the bottom part of the atmosphere that can sustain
life.

It's easy to forget how small the atmosphere and hydrosphere is
relative to the size of the planet.

  [ [ IMAGE ] ] 

* Biosphere

Life on the planet is divided into three primary environments,
terrestrial, fresh water and marine.

These are then in turn broken into different regions called /biomes/
which are characterized by their elevation (or depth in water
environments) atmospheric pressure, rainfall, sunlight, temperature
and soil.

Each biome is broken into smaller biotope which has a specific
collection of plants, animals and micro organisms.  Species of plants
and animals belong to specific biotopes and may differ between
biotopes even within the same biome as sub-species.

The biosphere is governed by the rotation of the earth which allows
the planet to evenly heat and cool, as well as seasonal heating and
cooling from the planet's orbit as it orbits closer or farther from
the sun.

The moon provide gravitational tidal effects which help increase
movement of water in oceans and lakes, as well as in the atmosphere.
Heating and cooling keeps air and water moving around the planet.

The poles recieve less sun than lower latitudes, and variations in the
length of day and night that increases as you move from the equator to
the poles.

The biosphere has water cycles which evaporates water into the
atmosphere, which precipitates back to the surface as rain or snow.
Which then runs off the surface of the planet into rivers and
eventually in the ocean.  Some of that water seeps into the
lithosphere and replentishes underground water stores.

There is a carbon cycle that is powered by plant and animal life.
Plants take in CO2 and spit out Oxygen.  Animals then take oxygen and
spit out CO2.

There is also a Nitrogen Cycle which is used by plants that cycles
nitrogen from the atmosphere to the soil and back again.

* Pace layers

This is a good place to introduce Steward Brand's concept of pace
layers.

Different things change at different speeds.

There are pace layers in nature
There are pace layers in civilization
There are pace layers in buildings

Slower layers govern and put a limit on the rate of faster layers

When layers get too far out of sync -- things break, and collapse and
very bad things happen that bring the different layers back into
balance.

For now we should understand how pace layers work on planetary and
geologic scales.

We could start at the penultimate scale which is the scale of our
universe and move down to layers within galaxies and then the life
cycle of stars.  But we will leave that as an exercise for another
time.  We are interested here in pace layers of a planet like earth.

The lithosphere is a pace layer -- with tecnonic plates chaning very
slowly over hundreds of millions of years.

Above that is the biosphere which encompasses all life and how it
helps to manage heat, provides a buffer from external forces such as
radiation in the form of ozone and a blanket of gases that absorb
radiation and regulate rainfall (????)

The atmosphere is largely a creation of life on the planet -- so is
soil and much in the oceans.

These things change at evolutionary time scales measured in millions
and perhaps tens or hundreds of thousand of years at the least.

When things get out of sync bad things happen -- hot house earth was
one 

4 of the 5 major extinction events which trigger climatic change that
results in wiping out at least 70% of species on the planet happened
because the biosphere was out of wack.

Each extinction event cleared out the dead wood, reset the system and
made way for evolution to speed up and create ever more complex and
varied life.

Humans have thrown a spanner in the works -- and is now seriously
messing with a very pleasant interglacial period that made human
civilization possible.  Our population has soared beyond the
biosphere's natural carrying capacity and is set to climb to around 10
billion before it will steeply drop off in the next century.  If any
other species had come even close to doing this, they would have
collapsed and died off.  But mankind has been able to artifically
extend carrying capacity again and again -- but it has come at a
terrible cost which we will soon have to pay.  It's very much
uncertain if we can innovate our way past this, until population
returns to a sustainable level and the biosphere can heal and bring
the climate back into the equilibrium that we have enjoyed for the
past xxx years.


we will come back to pace layers several more times.
--- 

The two World Wars were a result of different pace layers being so out
of sync that the world order had become destablized -- culture and
governance had not changed enough to keep pace with technology
infrastructure and fashion.  In a very distructive fashion, the ways
cleared away the old political systems and institutional and religious
relics that were so entrenched and loath to change that they collapsed
and made way for the final stage of industrialization, and the global
transporation, banking, legal infrastructure that industrialization
demanded.  It cleared the way for civil rights, womens rights, workers
rights, science and the expansion of education across economic and
class boundries that was needed to fill the jobs that
industrialization required.

The world today is still largely organized as an industrialized
civilization.  The problem with this, is that the industrial era gave
way to the globalization era starting in 1990, and the world and the
older industrialized political, social and economic infrastructure,
governance and education has not adapted to the new order.  Making the
changes needed to bring these layers back in sync would be hard
enough, but it is about to be be compounded exponentially by a third
revolution that will likely begin by the end of this decade
(around 2020) that will dwarf the changes of both industrialization
and globalization combined.  We are not prepared for this, and it will
need to be addressed as quickly and aggressively as possible if we are
to avoid a repeat of the two world wars.

* Living outside of Earth's Biosphere

For us to survive outside of earth we must bring an
atmosphere/hydrosphere/biosphere with us.  The atmosphere that we
breath today was created over billions of years by life on the
planet.

We can survive for years, perhaps decades outside the planet by
bringing with us an atmosphere and liquid water.  But in all
likelyhood we will eventually die without a functional biosphere to
support enough biodiversity to produce a health atmosphere, and the
food, we need from plants, animals and micro organisms.  We are
complex creatures that live in an extremely varied and complex
interdependent ecosystem.  We won't survive as a species unless we can
replicate an earth-like biosphere outside of the planet.

Life on earth began in the oceans -- and all land creatures are still,
deep down, largely ocean creatures that learned to walk, crawl or fly
and breath.

We are just starting to understand how the oceans work, and we are
still far from understanding the relationship between land and marine
environments.

It's likely that we will not be successful in recreating our
terrestrial biosphere without a corresponding marine biosphere that is
far larger than the terrestrial space.  So, yes, bringing the ocean
with us to mars will not just be for people who enjoy beaches and
eating fish.   It's likely that it will determine our long term
survival or not.

* Why is all of this important

Everything we are and ever will be is determined by our relationship
to the biosphere and the climate that the biosphere maintains.

* Transactive Man

Homo Sapiens is a transactive species, we lived in small groups called
bands and we divide knowledge and skills between members of the band
into specialties.  Man is not the only transactive species.
Transaction is found in a wide variety of species.  The original
specialization which is seen across most of the living world is the
divide between sexes.  The fact that half of a species can reproduce
and the other can only fertilize set the stage for man to evolve and
take trasaction to a new level.

The difference is that specialization in all creatures but man over
evolutionary time scales and was ingrained in the dna of the spieces
as behaviors.  There was a very hard limit to the amount that an
individual could learn on its own beyond what was hardwired into its
genes.

Man was already a tool builder, but the tools developed stayed the
same for hundreds of thousands of years with little change.  Man is
not the only species that builds tool, but again our first tools were
little more than more sophisticated versions of what other primates
used for tools.

The development of the neocortex in homo sapiens changed that, by
extending the primitive core parts of the brain with general purpose
pattern matching and memory that gave man the ability to learn to
adapt to their environment within a lifetime or at least a generation
or two.

The neocortex can be thought of as an extention of the brain, but that
extension didn't stop there.

Tools are an extension of our physical limbs, allowing us to extend
and amplify what we do far beyond the limits of our senses and
physical bodies.

Perhaps this is where we will go into Jared Diamond's theory about why
different peoples advanced and others didn't.  His answer is that it
depended on access to domesticated animals, a handful of domesticated
plants and if you were lucky enough to live in a river valley.

And this is where we stop talking about man as a species and mankind
as a larger concept that includes all of those domesticated animals,
plants, insects (the bee for instance) as well as animals like the
dog.  This is a broad definition of mankind and it will soon will have
to be expanded to include AI.  Mankind is a holon, man is just the
creature at the center who thinks he's calling the shots.


Spoken language was the next great leap.  Spoken language made it
possible to dramatically expand our ability to specialize and
communicate with each other.  It also established the oral tradition
(Havelock) which created a group encyclopedia of all a groups knowlege
that was passed on from generation to generation through song and
stories.  This maxed out around the time of Plato -- and corresponded
roughly with the invention of writing systems.

The ancient Greeks were the transitional stage between the oral and
the beginning of a written tradition that transformed civilization
from being pockets of tight-knit settlements into the first states.

Writing made a number of things possible -- it extended our ability to
think and reason, by externalizing short term memory as we worked out
problems over hours, days, years or even generations.

Writing is a form of time travel, allowing one to send messages to the
future and to places you will never see to people you will never meet.

Perhaps the most astonishing thing about spoken language, writing and
symbol systems is that it separated information from our brains.
Spoken language allowed us to more precisely share memories and
experiences so that a band would have an oral store of information
that was an extremely powerful survival skill.  But oral traditions
drift over time.  Memories become stories, stories become legands and
legands begin to dissolve into the myths.  Until writing systems were
invented there was no history.  History, is literally, what was
written.  There is no history before writing.  Many people don't
understand that history is not what happened in the past, but a record
of what was recorded in the past.

Information could now flow independent of people -- and information
took the form of not only writing, but currencies, that made trade far
more flexible, by using tokens that were made of something precious
(metals in most cases).

Permanent structures also transformed the territorial geographic areas
controlled by different groups into property.  It's no accident that
we use the same word for things we own, and for land under someone's
control.  It's a common belief that indigenious peoples did not
believe in land ownership -- which is only partly true -- but they
very much controlled territories collectively and would kill any
stranger who ventured in their territory.  The concept of land as
property, not territory was an advancement in that it made land an
abstract concept that could be marked off, mapped and controlled by
rules and laws rather than automaticically murdering anyone found in
the wrong place.  This layed the groundwork for travel and commerce
between different groups which was not possible before.  This whole
concept has now been taken to its logical limit, with land, within a
territory to be absolutely owned by the political power in control
forever -- this is now starting to hurt us more than it helps, it's
outlived its usefulness and is now stopping the migration of people
around the planet.  This is one of the biggest problems that we face
today -- and unless we can let go of the silliness of sovereignty as a
divine right -- we will face serious problems.  Borders are lines
painted on maps and signposts -- they are not real.  Treating them as
such divides us -- letting a handful of people control those borders
and the resources in the way we do today is not sustainable.

This is where legibility and the state sneaks into our story

It also set down oral traditions into external storage which help
synchronize those traditions over large geographic areas.  This helped
establish nations.  Writing systems were only used by a very small
percentage of the population for the next 2,000 years.


* Civilization

Civilization emerged from a long interglacial period that has been
extremely stable, and mild.  This clemant climatic period made it
possible for man to stop wandering the earth following the food.  We
gradually learned to cultivate plants and begin to domesticate
animals, but we didn't yet know how to keep the same land fertile over
many years.  So man ended up settling in a handful of river valleys
where we improved our agricultural techniques and learned to build
permanent strucutures.  The city was born, and with it, the wealth and
safety for a percentage of the population to spend their time
innovating -- in other word, civilizization.
