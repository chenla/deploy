We start with the basic unit being a planetary body.  Not just planets
but planetiods including moons and large asteroids suitible for
building habitats.

* Structure of the Earth

Earth has a core which is broken down into an inner core of solid
iron that gives the planet it's magnetic field (important for
sheilding life from solar and cosmic radiation) which is surrounded by
a molten core, which is surrounded by a semi stable mantle which makes
up the bulk of the planet's mass.  The mantle has a more stable upper
mantle which is then surrounded by a thin crust.  The more stable part
of the upper mantle and the crust are what we live on and are made up
of tectonic plates that move over time and rearrange the continents
and oceans.  This is known as the lithosphere.

Above the Lithosphere is the hydrosphere, which inludes all water in
the oceans and any water vapour in the atmosphere.  Above the
lithosphere is the atmosphere which is the razor thin mixture of
mostly nitrogen and 20% oxygen (and trace elements) what we live in.

Finally, the biosphere is the region between the bottom of the
hydrosphere and the bottom part of the atmosphere that can sustain
life.

It's easy to forget how small the atmosphere and hydrosphere is
relative to the size of the planet.

* Biosphere

Life on the planet is divided into three primary environments,
terrestrial, fresh water and marine.

These are then in turn broken into different regions called /biomes/
which are characterized by their elevation (or depth in water
environments) atmospheric pressure, rainfall, sunlight, temperature
and soil.

Each biome is broken into smaller biotope which has a specific
collection of plants, animals and micro organisms.  Species of plants
and animals belong to specific biotopes and may differ between
biotopes even within the same biome as sub-species.

The biosphere is governed by the rotation of the earth which allows
the planet to evenly heat and cool, as well as seasonal heating and
cooling from the planet's orbit as it orbits closer or farther from
the sun.

The moon provide gravitational tidal effects which help increase
movement of water in oceans and lakes, as well as in the atmosphere.
Heating and cooling keeps air and water moving around the planet.

The poles recieve less sun than lower latitudes, and variations in the
length of day and night that increases as you move from the equator to
the poles.

The biosphere has water cycles which evaporates water into the
atmosphere, which precipitates back to the surface as rain or snow.
Which then runs off the surface of the planet into rivers and
eventually in the ocean.  Some of that water seeps into the
lithosphere and replentishes underground water stores.

There is a carbon cycle that is powered by plant and animal life.
Plants take in CO2 and spit out Oxygen.  Animals then take oxygen and
spit out CO2.

There is also a Nitrogen Cycle which is used by plants that cycles
nitrogen from the atmosphere to the soil and back again.

* Living outside of Earth's Biosphere

For us to survive outside of earth we must bring an
atmosphere/hydrosphere/biosphere with us.  The atmosphere that we
breath today was created over billions of years by life on the
planet.

We can survive for years, perhaps decades outside the planet by
bringing with us an atmosphere and liquid water.  But in all
likelyhood we will eventually die without a functional biosphere to
support enough biodiversity to produce a health atmosphere, and the
food, we need from plants, animals and micro organisms.  We are
complex creatures that live in an extremely varied and complex
interdependent ecosystem.  We won't survive as a species unless we can
replicate an earth-like biosphere outside of the planet.

Life on earth began in the oceans -- and all land creatures are still,
deep down, largely ocean creatures that learned to walk, crawl or fly
and breath.

We are just starting to understand how the oceans work, and we are
still far from understanding the relationship between land and marine
environments.

It's likely that we will not be successful in recreating our
terrestrial biosphere without a corresponding marine biosphere that is
far larger than the terrestrial space.  So, yes, bringing the ocean
with us to mars will not just be for people who enjoy beaches and
eating fish.   It's likely that it will determine our long term
survival or not.
