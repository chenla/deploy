** Introduction

Habitats on Mars will likely be a combination of underground and
enclosed craters on the surface.

Domes will most likely be built in multiple layers with each layer
having  different pressure.  The outer layer can be nothing more than
concentrated martian atmosphere.  It doesn't have to be breathable, it
just needs to have pressure.

Rather than build domes like traditional buildings we could take a
much longer term approach.

  - Build the domes and pressurise using local atmosphere.
  - Use concentrated solar to raise and maintain the temperature above
    the freezing temperature of water.
  - Fill the floor of the dome with water -- it should basically now
    be a big domed lake that becomes a carbon store absorbing the C02.
  - Introduce microbes that each the C02 and over a decade or so
    create a breathable atmosphere in the dome.
  - As the atmosphere becomes breathable, introduce new organisms that
    eat the microbes that can then be eaten by terrestrial organisms
    as food -- this is the start of building an aquatic ecosystem with
    fish, shellfish etc.
  - Fence in and fill parts of the lake with organic matter to create
    paddies of land that can then be used to grow multi-level
    agriculture.
  - The result will be a very high production polyculture with a high
    biodiversity.
  - Take excess organic material to help build the same thing in other
    domes.

Keep industry and office spaces in the sides of the craters, which
would be zone zero.  Then ring the inside of the dome with domestic
houses, and then each zone nested inside will be visited less and
less.  The majority of the middle of the dome should be forrest or
open water. and as you move outwards it becomes more like Venice with
waterways between argriculture and buildings.

My initial questions are:

  - how big will these domes be
  - can we build them largely with little more than semi-autonomous
    robots and insitu materials.
  - what will be the population density that each dome will be able to
    support?  

My goal here is that we could have a central dome which would be an
urban/town center, surrounded by the little biospheres.  Ideally for
each person on Mars there should be several hectares of domed space,
and a lot of that will be made up of these agricultural habitats.

I know that we'll be able to 3D print clothes, and vat grow meat and
have indoor greens and vegitable production.  But this is fragile,
it's not building a civilization, it's not creating a permanent
home on the planet that acts as a backup for earth.  And it creates a
low quality of life that will leave us always feeling like we are
visitors on Mars rather than colonists.

These /little/ biospheres would not be so little -- I would image that
they would have to be minimum a hundred hectares in diameter, and
preferably a couple kilometers in diameter.

These are not trivial structures to build -- but the lower gravity
should help.

In the very long term these systems should be designed from day one,
so that over a couple of centuries as we terraform the planet we can
then strip away the outer layers of the domes until they are no longer
needed.   These domes then, are not just habitats but will become the
old-growth forrests and biomes for the new planet.

This is a long time in the future and the climate won't terraform
gently.  There will be heavy weather and errosion problems and a whole
host of other things that will make it difficult to protect the domes
for a long time.  But in the end the domes will become the centers
where ecosystems can grow out from and take over the planet.
