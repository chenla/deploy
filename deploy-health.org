* Introduction

Remember -- no promises -- deliver on day one.

Healthcare is a difficult subject that I've not really begun to tackle
but we need to get started on it asap.

Everyone is entitled to full healthcare from cradle to grave -- no
exceptions.

* Problems

Healthcare is a mess for any number of reasons:

  - it's being done for profit (hospitals, insurance companies & doctors)
  - equipment is made for profit
  - drugs are made for profit
  - it's not evenly distributed
  - little attempt to keep people healthy instead of waiting until
    they get sick -- would save a lot of resouces.
  - governments are inefficient - but are better than for-profit orgs
  - politics, inequality, racism, sexism and religious boneheads
  - patents patents patents

* Brainstorming

The following is nothing more than brainstorming, to come up with
ideas that could be developed further.

The first line of defence is the pharmacies -- add them to the
network, and give them a terminal so they can look up patient records
and make first-pass diagnosis -- should have bloodpressure, heart
monitor, and temp -- patient comes in and takes all three, it's fed
into their record and pharmacist makes decision to provide medication
or send them to clinic.  Collective buys drugs in bulk and sells at
cost to pharmacies -- people are given vouchers for getting free
medications if they go through the testing system first.

Build modular clinics that are distributed around bioregions -- they
are designed to monitor and manage health -- and deal with minor
illness and injury.

If more advanced expertise is required -- tele-presense can bring in
expert consultation.

Small drones can pick up samples and brought to labs for testing.

More advanced testing -- MRIs etc can be brought by drone dropships --
used and then picked up and moved to the next location.

Eventually, surgery will be completely replaced by robots -- robots
will be far better and cheaper than people ever could be.  Robotic
surgeries could even be mobile
