* Introduction

Remember -- no promises -- deliver on day one.

Healthcare is a difficult subject that I've not really begun to tackle
but we need to get started on it asap.

Everyone is entitled to full healthcare from cradle to grave -- no
exceptions.

Healthcare is a mess for any number of reasons:

  - it's being done for profit (hospitals, insurance companies & doctors)
  - equipment is made for profit
  - drugs are made for profit
  - it's not evenly distributed
  - little attempt to keep people healthy instead of waiting until
    they get sick -- would save a lot of resouces.
  - governments are inefficient - but are better than for-profit orgs
  - politics, inequality, racism, sexism and religious boneheads
  - patents patents patents
