  - drake's equation and the value of L
  - earth has an expiration date -- 1 billion years -- this is the
    ultimate practical scope for humans.
  - our first scope will be for technological civilization to survive
    the 10ky
  - undertake vast million year projects to move both mars and venus
    into better orbits, give them new, large moons and terraform them
    -- the lack of a magnetic field will be tricky though....
  - all heavy industry needs to move off planet, where resources are
    plentiful and energy easier to generate. 
  - establish a time keeping system based on seconds from epoch, which
    we can arbitrarily start from our present year 2000.


We need to spread out throughout the solar system and keep each
settlement small >2M, each has to be energy self-sufficient -- keep
movement to a minimum by making it largely unnecessary -- and maintain
large wilderness buffer zone that helps to regulate climate and
maintain biodiversity.
