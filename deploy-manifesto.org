* I.  The yellow brick road

 - fermi's paradox and the great filter (& drake's equation)
   if we are not exceptional then where is everyone?

 - biosphere
 - savannah
 - extend & externalize
   - mind  : brain, speech, writing (havelock), computer
   - muscle: hand, tool, machine, robot
 - transactive man
 - cooperation & war
 - polis -- the rise of annuals and decline of perennials
 - pace layers

 - cognitive revolution
   - we had to give up our intestines which provided more
     energy for the brain but limited our diet -- so without
     cooking we survive poorly
   - we gave up our hearing to dogs
   - childbirth became quite dangerous
   - children born prematurely -- need long period of care
     but means that children's development can be molded
   - we have more nerve endings in our hands

  - stories make cooperation between large groups possible
    -- havelock and homer as oral cultural encyclopedia


   - between 70-30kya sapiens developed speech
   - stories -- gossip makes larger groups possible


* II  Fragility

 - fragility of our biosphere
   - asteroid and comet strikes
   - solar storms
   - super volcanos
   - hothouse coldhouse

 - fragility of our species

 - fragility of our civilization



 - centralized

* III Estranged

 - the mind's illusion
 - myth of progress
 - energy
 - estranged from ourselves
   - savannah lost
   
* IV  Storms

 - goods, people and know how
 - population and the great pin -- as child mortality drops,
   and education increases, birthrate falls  -- this could
   well become the mechanism for man to regulate it's own
   population to compensate for our quick rise to becoming
   an apex predator and keystone species,


 - an end to our clement climate

 - the sound of inevitibility -- "you hear that mister anderson, it's
   the sound of inevitability - Smith"

 - disease
 - black swans, collapse, and world killers 

 - singularity or nightfall 

 - chances of survival (Gott)

* V   Maps & Stories

 - climate shapes our relationship with the world, and our worldview
   -- monsters and the critics.  it could be said that most cultural
   differences are derived from the different way we solve problems to
   adapt to the local climate.  temperature, rainfall, proximity to
   rivers or lakes or oceans, length of days and nights are all part
   and parcel of the mechanics of our daily lives -- Tolkien quote.

 - ariadne's Thread -- maps, narratives and territories
 - indistinguishable from magic -- mitigating complexity -- we need
   mythos to map technology so we can relate to it, understand it and
   use it.
 - language & mythos as interface
 - transcending and returning to human scales

* VI  The Window

 - The Window -- 50 years plus or minus 20

 - the only thing that has saved us after we have fouled our
   own beds and made them uninhabitable is that we move on
   to the next place and reduce pressure on our old homes to
   let them heal, if we haven't destroyed it beyond its
   ability to heal.  we expand or we die.

 - but we are now faced with the fact that we have nearly
   exhausted all of the low hanging fruit -- energy and
   natural resources and our population has exceeded the
   carrying capacity of the biosphere.

 - we need to expand into the solar system -- where there is
   no shortage of natural resources and energy

    - all energy is nuclear, be it fossil fuels, wind or
      solar or our own limmited ability to split or fuse the
      atom

    - it is likely that within a lifetime or two at most,
      the majority of energy that mankind uses will be for
      computation -- even today, Google alone represents 1-2
      percent of energy use in the united states.  solar and
      renewables can likely satisfy all of our other energy
      requirements -- but not computation

  - we must bring the savannah with us where ever we go --
    we need to learn to create and manage the biospheres we
    live in, and move to an ecological accounting system
    that really balances

  - the illusion of wilderness -- man has had a far greater
    impact on the planet than we want to admit -- we were in
    large part, responsible for the extinction of a huge
    swath of megafuana around the planet from mastadons, to
    giant slothes -- in north america, austrailia, new
    zeland -- american's like to wax romantic about the
    great untouched wilderness of north america with the
    original people's living there living in harmony with
    nature.  The jaw dropping landscapes of John Muir, the
    thunderous herds of bison numbering in the millions
    didn't exist two hundred years before Muir took up his
    paint brush -- the wilderness had only been untouched by
    man after small pox and the plague wiped out 80-90% of
    the population in the America's when early contact
    between Europe was made with the America's.  The
    pilgrams literally built their colony on the bones of
    the dead.

  - we will need to master of geoengineering -- first, to
    carve out habitable places in the cracks and crevices of
    the solar system, and eventually, to fix the mess we've
    created here on earth.

  - we need to become a truly distributed species

  - the city is not the savannah, and it never can be --
    cities exist because of the limitations of moving goods,
    people and knowledge -- if you can truly distribute
    those three things, then the mega cities we have today
    will no longer be needed.

  - we need to learn to manage the savannah inside us as
    well, our aggressive tendencies, our cognitive biases,
    our innate laziness, greed and tribal territorialism --
    we can no longer afford these luxuries and must set them
    aside as childish things

  - we must stop thinking of ourselves as a single species
    and embrace our transactive nature a broader concept of
    mankind that includes everything from our dogs and
    eventually to ai

  - we must let go of the illusion of the individual --
    homesteaders, doomsday preppers,

    even Thoreau, living his solitary life, relied on tools
    that had been created by an industrial chain that mined
    and refined ore into metals that were turned into tools,
    on textiles that started with farmers growing cotton or
    shearing sheep, which were spun into threads which were
    died different colors and woven into fabrics that were
    fashioned into clothes.  His shoes and boots started
    with the hides cut from megafauna, which was tanned and
    and fashioned into his shoes and boots.  and finally, he
    relied, though it's not certain how much, on food that
    was cooked by his mother (the story of his mother came
    from the permaculture book).

  - we are wired to wander but no cut adrift as individuals
    but as members of small bands of 10-25 people.  this is
    very natural -- children grow up and marry into other
    bands.
  
    and as our lifespans increase, we will likely change
    from being a species with a single arc of youth, middle
    age and old age, to a very long middle age where we will
    cycle through a cycles of career, and child rearing.
    Each of these cycles might be within the same band, but
    more likely we will form a band to either have a career
    or raise a child, and when that cycle is over when the
    children have grown and gone off you will take a break,
    grow bored and then move on to form another band.  This
    would constitute a kind of rebirth for the individual to
    start fresh and recharged for a new cycle of their
    lives.  perhaps this would even correspond with a
    physical rejuvenation as well -- getting treatment to
    turn back the clock a couple of decades, perhaps
    changing your ethnicity, culture, language, or even
    gender to begin a new cycle.

  - we need to stop thinking of ourselves as being one
    person from birth to death -- we are different people at
    different times in our lives and need to acknowledge
    this fact and reflect it in the way we treat things like
    success and failure and mistakes made.  this is
    especially true when it comes to mistakes -- you make a
    mistake, and should be held accountable for that mistake
    in the arc you are in, but eventually you will evolve
    into a different person and that person should be given
    the chance to start a new arc fresh -- but this will
    take time

  - rituals of divorce -- our cultures are wired for single
    arc lifetimes --
