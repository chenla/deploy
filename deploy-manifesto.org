* I.  Origins

 - fermi's paradox and the great filter (& drake's equation)

 - biosphere
 - savannah
 - extend & externalize -- brain, speech, writing (havelock)
 - transactive man
 - cooperation & war
 - pace layers

* II  Fragility

 - fragility of our civilization
 - centralized

* III Estranged

 - the mind's illusion
 - myth of progress
 - energy
 - estranged from ourselves
   - savannah
   
* IV  Storms

 - goods, people and know how
 - population and the great pin
 - an end to our clement climate

* V   Maps & Stories

 - Ariadne's Thread -- maps, narratives and territories
 - mitigating complexity
 - language & mythos as interface
 - transcending and returning to human scales

* VI  Expand or Extinct

 - the only thing that has saved us after we have fouled our own beds
   and made them uninhabitable is that we move on to the next place
   and reduce pressure on our old homes to let them heal, if we
   haven't destroyed it beyond its ability to heal.  we expand or we die.

 - but we are now faced with the fact that we have nearly exhausted
   all of the low hanging fruit -- energy and natural resources and
   our population has exceeded the carrying capacity of the biosphere.

 - we need to expand into the solar system -- where there is no
   shortage of natural resources and energy

    - all energy is nuclear, be it fossil fuels, wind or solar or our
      own limmited ability to split or fuse the atom

    - it is likely that within a lifetime or two at most, the majority
      of energy that mankind uses will be for computation -- even
      today, Google alone represents 1-2 percent of energy use in the
      united states.  solar and renewables can likely satisfy all of
      our other energy requirements -- but not computation

  - we need to learn to create and manage the biospheres we live in,
    and move to an ecological accounting system that really balances

  - we will need to master of geoengineering -- first, to carve out
    habitable places in the cracks and crevices of the solar system,
    and eventually, to fix the mess we've created here on earth.

  - we need to become a truly distributed species

  - the city is not the savannah, and it never can be -- cities exist
    because of the limitations of moving goods, people and knowledge
    -- if you can truly distribute those three things, then the mega
    cities we have today will no longer be needed.

  - we need to learn to manage the savannah inside us as well, our
    aggressive tendencies, our cognitive biases, our innate laziness,
    greed and tribal territorialism -- we can no longer afford these
    luxuries and must set them aside as childish things

  - we must stop thinking of ourselves as a single species and embrace
    our transactive nature a broader concept of mankind that includes
    everything from our dogs and eventually to ai
