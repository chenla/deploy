** Introduction

Mass transit sucks.  It's important in large urban centers but it's
inevitably alienating, impersonal and lonely.

Cars provide more mobility, but they isolate people from other people
and the processing of traveling -- you're in a bubble, only seeing the
journey from inside a protective shell.

Walking, bicycles and motos are very personal and mobile.  There is no
barrier between you and the world -- the weather, the road and other
people.  End points are where you are going, not from a garage to a
parking space.
