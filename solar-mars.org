We will not be concerning ourselves with getting to mars, initial
survival on mar or building and maintaining a settlement.  We start
where Musk's first stage finihes and he is now ferrying hundreds of
thousands of people to the planet.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  In many ways, the transportation problem of getting us to Mars, over
  the long term is the smallest problem that we will be facting.
  Transplanting civilization to Mars will not be a matter of setting
  up quonset huts with hydroponic farms with people in bubble helmeted
  suits riding in dune buggies off the cover of Amazing Stories or an
  inspiring Robert McCall mural on the wall of the Air and Space
  Museum on the Washington Mall.

  These are visions of exploration and technology, they embody the
  bold confident optimisim of Apollo program.  But ultimately they are
  visions of a research stations.  It's what you have at McMurdy
  Station in Antarctica.  And ultimately it's a thoroughly depressing
  vision if you starting thinking about living in these paintings over
  years and decades.  It doesn't age well, it's existence, not life.

  We need to start thinking in terms of building a permanent
  civilization on Mars, a home, albeit very different from Earth, but
  still a place that you would want to live.  For that we need to be
  thinking as architects, and communities planners.

  It will need to be able to cut the cord with Earth, as soon as
  possible if not sooner.  That will mean not only building computer
  chips, but sourcing and refining the silica.  It won't only be
  building systems that produce breathable air, potable water and
  sewage, but public utilities that are paid for by something like a
  tax system.

  We don't need to transplant the "American way of life" or any other
  such nonsense.  Rather we need to provide the initial conditions for
  an open economy, with commerce, manufacturing and a government to
  emerge as the colony becomes a community.  We have to encourage
  local businesses and startups not just work for the inevitable
  multinationals from the home world who will sponsor many parts of
  the early stages and inevitably pump large amounts of money to stake
  out large corporate claims on the planet.

* Musk's Million on Mars

A million people is not just a million people -- it must include a
whole ecosystem that is complex enough to be able to self-correct,
that includes everything from microbes to mega-fauna -- this will be
the biggest challenge -- the biosphere experiments are many orders of
magnitude too simple.  It's not just creating a pressurized breathable
atmosphere, that is easy at small scales, but it won't scale.  That
was the whole point of Robinson's critique of generation ships -- that
the ecosystems in the ships will be too simple to be antifragile --
there are too many things that will knock them out of wack and cascade
and collapse.  At scale it will all end very badly with the approaches
we are using at the moment.  The sum of our parts is larger than
ourselves, from the microbes in our guts to fucking knows what else.
We need to work out how to bring earth with us everywhere we go and we
simply don't know how to do it.
