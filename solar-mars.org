* Introduction

#+begin_quote
“ Designing protocols that work across vast distances like planets
makes it possible for people around the Earth that are in distant
areas far away from the data center to connect as easily and nicely as
people in the nice vast cities like this one. This is what we call the
interplanetary principle. Design things for planets — planetary
scale — and you will do very well on Earth.”

-- Juan Benet

We will not be concerning ourselves with getting to mars, initial
survival on mar or building and maintaining a settlement.  We start
where Musk's first stage finishes and he is now ferrying hundreds of
thousands of people to the planet.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  In many ways, the transportation problem of getting us to
  Mars, over the long term is the smallest problem that we
  will be facing.  Transplanting civilization to Mars will
  not be a matter of setting up quonset huts with hydroponic
  farms with people in bubble helmeted suits riding in dune
  buggies off the cover of Amazing Stories or an inspiring
  Robert McCall mural on the wall of the Air and Space
  Museum on the Washington Mall.

  These are visions of exploration and technology, they
  embody the bold confident optimisim of the Apollo program.
  But ultimately they are visions of research stations.
  It's what you have at McMurdy Station in Antarctica.  And
  ultimately it's a thoroughly depressing vision if you
  start thinking about living in these paintings over years
  and decades.  It doesn't age well, it's existence, not
  life.

  We need to start thinking in terms of building a permanent
  civilization on Mars, a home, albeit very different from
  Earth, but still a place that you would want to live.  For
  that we need to be thinking as architects, and community
  planners.

  It will need to be able to cut the cord with Earth, as
  soon as possible if not sooner.  That will mean not only
  building computer chips, but sourcing and refining the
  silica.  It won't only be building systems that produce
  breathable air, potable water and sewage, but public
  utilities that are paid for by something like a tax
  system.

  We don't need to transplant the "American way of life" or
  any other such nonsense.  Rather we need to provide the
  initial conditions for an open economy, with commerce,
  manufacturing and a government to emerge as the colony
  becomes a community.  We have to encourage local
  businesses and startups not just work for the inevitable
  multinationals from the home world who will sponsor many
  parts of the early stages and inevitably pump large
  amounts of money to stake out large corporate claims on
  the planet.

* Musk's Million on Mars

A million people is not just a million people -- it must include a
whole ecosystem that is complex enough to be able to self-correct,
that includes everything from microbes to mega-fauna -- this will be
the biggest challenge -- the biosphere experiments are many orders of
magnitude too simple.  It's not just creating a pressurized breathable
atmosphere, that is easy at small scales, but it won't scale.  That
was the whole point of Robinson's critique of generation ships -- that
the ecosystems in the ships will be too simple to be antifragile --
there are too many things that will knock them out of wack and cascade
and collapse.  At scale it will all end very badly with the approaches
we are using at the moment.  The sum of our parts is larger than
ourselves, from the microbes in our guts to fucking knows what else.
We need to work out how to bring earth with us everywhere we go and we
simply don't know how to do it.

* Fuck the facts!

Actually no, but it felt good to type that...



The whole thing  about mars is that 95% of what we need to
do there is little different from what we do there.  It will
required a lot of specialties and a lot of non-space type
shit.

*** Notes for page 1

Musk's goal is to build up a permanent population on Mars of one
million people over 40-100 years.  This will require 10,000 trips
carrying 100 people each.

* Mars Whitepaper Outline


** Four Stages

 - get there, establish base
 - sustainable settlement
 - distributed civilization
 - terraform
** Civilization is about specialties
** automation -- ai & robots

** It must be distributed
 - heavy industry -- 99% automated and even remote
 - everything else is a fabric of cottage industry that
   leverages ai and robotics to massively multiply
   production
 - we'll be living inside terrariums -- which are
   vulnerable to disease -- can not put everything in one
   basket...
** It will only work on mars if it works on earth
 - 80% of what you do on mars is no different on earth, just
   in extreme cold and indoors and largely underground.
 - build a mars civilization in every backyard on earth
 - people can start shops and join guilds on earth and then
   take what they learn and then to do it on mars.
 - the system will be it's own blockchain based economy,
   establish crypto-credit unions to save money for the trip
   and to get established on mars
** everything is agriculture
 - growing an atmosphere, not air production
 - gmo starts from day one
 - everyone grows stuff, everywhere - no exceptions
** leave all baggage behind
 - plant no flags
 - no earth-based territories or borders
 - earth corporations must assimilate
 - you're all martians now -- that's your new identity
 - assimilate or don't come
 - no room for national identities
 - no room for ideologies (social, religious, economic)
 - no food or clothing ideologies allowed
 - no splinter settlements (at least in the first million)
** open designs & knowledge
 - nothing is proprietary
 - generative designs and plans
 - build structures and things that live
** nothing is disposable
 - build to last
 - interchangable modular everything
 - build to be repairable
 - gracefully degrade
** getting good at living inside
 - we're going to be stuck inside for hundreds of years so
   we better get really really good at it.
 - we have to get really really good at tunneling
** stage everything in antarctica
 - if it can't work there it won't work on mars -- not only
   materially sustainable, but economically.
 - fail fast and often 
 - everyone going to mars must first be done in antarctica
   for anywhere from 6 months to 2 years -- assimilation
   starts there.
 - includes all fuel production, growing food, making
   atmosphere, medicine, electronics, heavy industry etc.
** Education comes first and last
** don't wait to start building solar civilization
 - mars is not an end, it is a gateway to the solar system
 - build heavy industry in asteroid belt
 - get good at moving big rocks and ice
 - process insitu while it's being moved
 - learn to live in big rocks as well as you do on mars or earth
