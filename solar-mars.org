* Introduction




* an experiment 

okay -- on mars, what if we try an experiment.  Let's take a
excavated cavern -- X tall and X wide and long.  What can
you build or grow in that space -- what would it produce?
Can it sustain itself?  What kind of biodiversity is
required (big fucking question that) and how many people
would it support.  Then work out how many shops that the
cavern would support.  It would be an underground village.

Lakes and ponds are somewhat closed ecosystems that work in
small spaces -- we're building terrariums that we will live
in.

There will be buildings -- but in a lot of cases we'll be
living in the walls of the cavern, like hobbits.
