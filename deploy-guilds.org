* Introduction

* Guilds

There are two kinds of guilds,  are often defined as an association of
people working toward a common goal.

----

A guild is a mesh of mutual dependencies and obligations -- guilds are
how we transcend the limitations of ourselves as individuals -- they
are what turns a group of parts into a holon

A holon is the structure -- the guild are the bonds that bind things
together into holons.[fn:1]

This principle should apply to everything -- structure and the bonds
that hold them together -- that's the thing I think is missing from
directed graphs -- it's all about the structure not the bonds that bind
the structures.  It's not enough to wave your hands and say "ah,
relationships" "as many as you want", as if they were gyros on
Blaylock's Elfin Ship.


So what are bonds?  a process?  as in the process of one thing
becoming something else?  which means a link is transformative --
the act of linking changes what is linked, becoming something else...

the mental model I always had of directed graphs is static atoms with
links pointing to other atoms, when in fact each link transforms both
atoms on each side of the graph to become something greater than what
it was before -- the total becoming more than the sum of its parts

why the fuck hasn't anyone explained it that way before?  it's obvious
as soon as you see it.

    relationships are verbs not adjectives/predicates
 
a RDF statement is defined as a 3-tuple (triple) consisting of:

   - subject:= the node the statement/edge starts at
   - predicate := a semantically important label for for the
     statement/edge
   - object := the node that the statement/edge terminates at


* Professional Guilds

At their best Guilds played an important role in maintaining quality
and professional standards, safe guarded knowledge, organized supply
tool chains and were responsible for passing knowledge and skills from
generation to generation.

At their worst through many checkered centuries , guilds exercised
rent seeking, monoplies, political influence, and even murder.


Guilds were, in some cases the prototypes for and the nucleous of
Universities such as Oxford and Paris.

The guild was made up by experienced and confirmed experts in their
field of handicraft. They were called master craftsmen. Before a new
employee could rise to the level of mastery, he had to go through a
schooling period during which he was first called an apprentice. After
this period he could rise to the level of journeyman. Apprentices
would typically not learn more than the most basic techniques until
they were trusted by their peers to keep the guild's or company's
secrets.

Like journey, the distance that could be travelled in a day, the title
'journeyman' derives from the French words for 'day' (jour and
journée) from which came the middle English word journei. Journeymen
were able to work for other masters, unlike apprentices, and generally
paid by the day and were thus day labourers. After being employed by a
master for several years, and after producing a qualifying piece of
work, the apprentice was granted the rank of journeyman and was given
documents (letters or certificates from his master and/or the guild
itself) which certified him as a journeyman and entitled him to travel
to other towns and countries to learn the art from other
masters. These journeys could span large parts of Europe and were an
unofficial way of communicating new methods and techniques, though by
no means all journeymen made such travels — they were most common in
Germany and Italy, and in other countries journeymen from small cities
would often visit the capital.

After this journey and several years of experience, a journeyman could
be received as master craftsman, though in some guilds this step could
be made straight from apprentice. This would typically require the
approval of all masters of a guild, a donation of money and other
goods (often omitted for sons of existing members), and the production
of a so-called "masterpiece,' which would illustrate the abilities of
the aspiring master craftsman; this was often retained by the
guild.

A lot of the problem with Guilds is that they had few if any checks
and balances outside their organization.

This needs to be addressed first within their charters, second within
the organization of the guilds themselves, and finally from outside of
the organization.

Some ideas:

  - all guild knowledge must be placed in the public domain under free
    licences that protect it from monologies.
  - guilds should have no representation in civil governance beyond an
    advisory roles.
  - rent seeking is strictly prohibitive, though revenue can be
    generated to cover costs of the organization.
  - membership is open to anyone.
  - guilds can not own property or companies.
  - guilds must depend on each other.

Further, guilds will responsible for scholarly and research into their
knolwedge domain -- they will work with researchers and scientists to
apply new findings to refine and extend the state of the art -- I
would guess that a lot of pure research will sponsored by guilds.

Guilds are holons -- they are self-contained wholes and parts of a
larger whole.

Guilds overlap, and there will be any number of instances of
individuals belonging to more than one guild...

* Crop Guilds

A crop Guild is a grouping of plants, trees, animals, insects, and
other components that work together to mimic aspects of ecosystems.
