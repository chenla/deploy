* Introduction

I was originally going to break this up into /ecosystems/ and
/polyculture/.  But in a larger context, polyculture is simply a more
complex means of what early North American inhabitants did; manage
ecosystems.  European farming is based on the concept of
specialization, of focusing on a subset or part of a whole and largely
excluding the role that that part plays in the whole.  It is a holon
that only looks inward, as a complete whole, rather than as a part of
something larger than itself.  In the heat of the exponential
explosion of science, technology and innovation in the 19th and 20th
centuries this was as much a coping mechanism as it was a failing.
There was too much happening all at once, and the tools available to
manage the flood of information weren't much changed from the 19th
century beyond the introduction of the technology like the typewriter,
mimeograph and later photocopy machines.

Monoculture agriculture is a perfect example of late 19th and 20th
century specialization that ignored that a giant field of corn was
still just a small part that depended on a far larger ecosystem.

Polyculture at its best, integrates with and manages local ecosystems.
At worst Polyculture at least attempts to mimic natural ecosystems and
create far more robust interdependent systems than monocultures do.

Natural systems are certainly not perfect, they are constantly going
in and out of balance as climate and environmental factors change.
Animals and plants succeed, die off and eventually go extinct through
all of this.  In retrospect, the periods when systems were in relative
equilibrium were short to the point that they were almost aberrations.

Civilization was built during one of these aberrations, which mankind
has done its level best to destroy.  We are now at the very beginning
of what will be centuries of instability.  That is the new norm, and
we better get very good at managing it.
