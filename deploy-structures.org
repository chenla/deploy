... the contrast between these two buildings in fact offers a
brilliantly concrete demonstration of the dual premises that underlie
her book. The first is that architecture possesses what she describes
as a profound capacity to "make a difference"—to exert a fundamental
influence on our quality of life by literally shaping our activities
and experiences. The second is that this capacity is best understood
not in the abstract terms of aesthetics or history but by looking
closely at the actual mechanics of our daily interactions with
buildings; by trying to understand how we live in and move through
them.
