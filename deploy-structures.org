... the contrast between these two buildings in fact offers a
brilliantly concrete demonstration of the dual premises that underlie
her book. The first is that architecture possesses what she describes
as a profound capacity to "make a difference"—to exert a fundamental
influence on our quality of life by literally shaping our activities
and experiences. The second is that this capacity is best understood
not in the abstract terms of aesthetics or history but by looking
closely at the actual mechanics of our daily interactions with
buildings; by trying to understand how we live in and move through
them.

"You say to brick, 'What do you want, brick?' . . . Brick says to you,
'I like an arch.' If you say to brick, 'Arches are expensive, and I
can use a concrete lintel over an opening. What do you think of that,
brick?' Brick says, 'I like an arch.'"

Drawing on speeches and letters from Kahn's time in Dhaka supervising
the construction of his design for the National Assembly Building of
Bangladesh, Lesser suggests that he saw the project not merely as
providing a site for the young nation's parliament to meet but as
physically establishing democracy there—as if the spatial
configuration of his building would bear as much responsibility for
good governance as the legal structure of a constitution.

For Kahn, the ultimate source of architecture's power was its ability
to communicate. He believed that buildings are composed of "universal
elements" that have remained essentially unchanged throughout the
ages, and so constitute a kind of ancestral spatial language shared by
all of humanity.
