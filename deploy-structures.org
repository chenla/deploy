A NEW ARCHITECTURE, A NEW CIVILIZATION

Our book describes a revolutionary vision of the human
environment: one which will, in coming eras, be conceived,
designed, built, made, and widely understood as a necessity
of emotional and social life.  This will inevitably change
the way we conduct ourselves in all the arts of building.

From the very building of the building project described in
this book, we intend to show that architecture can bring
life to a community -- indeed, that it is neccessary in
order to help the community come to life.  Thus, we mean to
show how the physical fabric of the buildings plays a
necessary and unavoidable role in the success of a
community.

But in 1985, there was almost no tradition left that could
support such a symbiosis of building form, social behavior,
and human feeling.  Building production systems did not even
know (then or now) how to make themselves comfortable in
their own environment -- not in the obvious sense, and not
in any subtle senses either.

This gradual, steady deterioration of environmental quality
has been occuring all over the world, on every continent, in
every society, and in every nation state.

The extent of this loss can hardly be exaggerated.  For at
least a thousand years, and probably three or four times
that length of time there was a universal regard for the
importance and beauty of the buildings that were made.  For
those who had money, the money was lavished on the most
beautiful paintings and ornaments, on the magnificence of
harmony and proportion.  For those who had little money,
they used their own hands.  Even in buildings made of mud
and straw or snow, people used their own hands to make
something beautiful that would be cherished.

The following quote doesn't belong here -- but I'm parking
it here until I work out where to use it.

#+begin_quote
The organization of nature is not modular in the sense that
modern architecture has been made from prefabricated modular
components.  Someone may ask, what about atoms, what about
molecures, making the false assumption that electrons,
atoms, and molecules are modular and identical.  But this is
altogether mistaken.  The discipline of quantum mechanics
established many decades ago that the quantum field sets up
special, effective conditions that make each atom become
unique under the influence of its quantum field.  Hence any
two electrons are different, according to time and place,
thus always depending on their context.

What is more to the point is that the reality of things --
what I call the reality -- comes from the structure of
something which /at every level/ is highly complex and
unique.

#+begin_quote
Architecture is now only transmitted /through drawings/.
The typical architect does not personally know how to make
anything -- not buildings, not windows, not floors or
ceilings.  He or she draws drawings.  We are, by now, so
deeply enmeshed in this way of thinking, that it doesn't
sound like idiocy.  It sounds like a very practical thing to
do.  But it is, in fact, idiocy.  Mass production has turned
architecture on its head!!

** Introduction

Building structures that provide shelter is certainly
nothing unique to our species.  Ants and termites tunnel and
build elaborate colonies, bees build hives.  Birds have been
building nests since they were dinosaurs.  Structures are a
natural extension of basic survival instants.  If there is a
choice of staying out in the rain or in a dry shelter, those
who gravitate for the less hostile environment will have a
better chance of survival.  Most shelters are used primarily
to better the chances of their offspring to survive when
they are young and less able to survive in the open.

Early man was adept at wandering the planet, and the ability
to construct garments which extended environmental extremes
of hot and cold in which man could survive was coupled with
structures that extended that protection even farther and
afforded some protection against predators.

The structures we build are extensions of ourselves as
individuals and culturally as groups.  They play an enormous
role in how we percieve the world around us, and shape what
activities that we are able to conduct from day to day.

It is fair to say that mankind is an indoor species whose
primary activity outside of the structures we build for
outselves is to travel to other structures.  Even
transportation evolved to become essentially moveble
structures, so that some one living in a an extremely hot
and dry climate such as you find in the middle east or
southwest United States spend their days going from an air
conditioned house to an air conditioned car to an air
conditioned shop and back to the air conditioned car and
then to an air conditioned office.  The amount of time spent
out of doors for many people living in cities like Pheonix
or Abu Dabbi is so small that in practice, they might as
well be living in man made habitats on Mars.  You'll still
be able to go outside once in a while, you'll just need a
tad more clothing to survive in antarctic temperatures
and.... a portable pressurized atmosphere.

** What the hell happened in the 20th Century?

For a species that depends so completely on the structures
we live in, it is almost beyond comprehension how fucking
awful we have been at making them for the past hundred
years.

Modernism, which striped any connection that people had with
the nature and our environment, has been responsible for
striping the lives of billions of people bare of their own
culture and humanity.  Modernism is souless, bland,
uncomfortable and far more disfunctional than most people
realise because they have never known anything else.

In the 1990's Hong Kong ran a series of public service
commercials that showed before and after scenarios of life
in Hong Kong.  In the before scenario we see a vibrant
street scene with food carts, and people laughing and joking
and looking pretty happy, though they are packed together in
a way that could only be normal in Hong Kong.  In the after
scenario, the carts and the people are gone, and you see a
single adult holding a child's hand as they walk across an
empty street.  It's so empty, that if it was an American
Western film, you'd see a tumbleweed rolling across behind
them.  The /bad/ scenario had all the things that had made
Hong Kong such a vibrant and alive place to live.  The
/good/ scenario looked more like the empty streets that you
see in Zombie movies just before the undead come streaming
out of the abandoned buildings to feast on your brains.  At
some point, on some unconscious level, the makers of the
commercials must have understood this as well and added in
/dangerous/ things happening in the /bad/ scenario.  The
worst, was a police raid on the pushcarts that forced the
hawkers to flee the scene, splashing hot oil on a little
girl and burning her.  They didn't seem to realise that the
only reason this happened was because of the police trying
to clear the street for the zombies to come.

What the government was really trying to do was to turn Hong
Kong into Singapore who had already, a generation before,
turned their city-state into a sterile /after/ scenario
where any street life is carefully managed and choreographed
in a strange parody of people living in a healthy living
culture.

This same process has since been repeated in countless
cities around the world, sucking the life out of each place
where it has been done.  This has become the new normal, and
again, few people understand how awful it is.

Christopher Alexandar dedicated his entire life's work to
rediscover what had been lost and develop methodoligies for
modern people to build structures that enhanced people's
lives rather than dehumanized them.  The resulting book, /A
Pattern Language/ became one of the largest selling books on
architecture in history.  APL is a singular masterpiece,
that should have sparked an architectural revolution that
changes the direction of modern architecture.  But the
buildings that were built using APL, if anything were as bad
or worse than what they were supposed to replace.  People
treated the work as a cookbook of ideas, that they could dip
into here and there and make a building.  It turns out that
there were far deeper things happening in good buildings
that people had forgotten.

Over the next decades Alexandar dedicated to discovering
what those deeper patterns were, and how to create buildinds
that embodied and expressed them.  The result was a
monumental three volume work called "The Nature of Order".
In TNOR Alexandar attempted something astonishing, to not
only discover what we lost in the modern era, which was a
deep emotional and physical connection between ourselves,
our buildings and the world they are part of.  He sought to
take what he discovered out of the realm of /gut feelings/
and put it on an empirical scientific footing.

I believe that Alexandar's work will someday be thought of
as akin to the work of John Hooke's early scientific
achievements.  Like Alexandar, Hooke was the first to
discover a wide range of things without anything to guide
him in what he found.  Everything was new.  So it's not
surprising that the first pass of huge swaths of scientific
enquiry was wildly off the mark.  But Hooke, like Alexandar
laid the groundwork for the hundreds of thousands who would
come afterwords and build on his work.

There are two reasons that I will be spending so much time
on structures.  First, when people feel connected to the
environment they live in, their priorities are very
different from people who live in sterile environments that
pretend they are not part of the world.  The latter group of
people see no problem with denying climate change, and
poisoning the air they breath and the water they drink.  And
they can't even imagine living in a world that wasn't like
the one they live in now.  They are the frogs slowly boiling
alive in a pan on the burner, and will die not know that
they were the ones that had been turning up the flame all
along.  The second is that when Mankind makes the transition
from being an Earth based species to a Solar-based species,
we will really be an indoor species, because we can't
survive outside.  The brief bits of fresh air, and natural
breeze, the odd holiday at the beach, are physically and
psychologically vital for our species.  If we are going to
condemn a large percentage of our fellow man to spend
centuries or even millennia indoors as we terraform other
places in the solar system, and re-terraform the fucking
mess we've made of Earth's climate, we better get damn good at
makeing the indoors we will be stuck in, really really good,
because we sure suck at it today...

** Habitability Matrix

It's critical that we don't loose sight of the fact that no
matter where we are, we still have the same matrix of basic
environmental needs for humans to be able to survive.

 - atmosphere
 - pressure
 - gravity
 - temperature
 - light
 - radiation

And that even when we are building things on earth we can
not take them as being givens, because a lot of things we
take for granted in terms of temperature and atmosphere will
change rapidly in the next century.  We will need to think
of the earth as far more hostile to human life than we think
of it now -- we won't be camping on the beach like Ulysses,
we're going to head straight into the cozy warm and safe
beer hall.

So every time we build or design something, we must be
consciously aware of the environmental parameters that the
design requires to support life.  It will seem strange at
first, but it's a first step towards being a solar species
and civilization.

** Outline

  


   
  - habitat :: a habitat is both structure, atmosphere,
    climate and ecosystem.

    - artificial habitats :: on most of earth artifical
         habitats (other than buildings) are not required
         unless you are in the antarctic, or underwater, but
         everywhere else you need to bring with you a
         pressurized, temperature controlled atmosphere that
         replicates the functions of a self-regulating
         ecosystem -- don't forget light!
    - natural habitats :: are broken down into bioregions
  - process :: buildings have a beginning, but initial
    construction is just a fraction of what will
    eventually be constructed over time
  - maintenance ::
  - infrastructure ::
  - transportation ::
  - structures :: (buildings, bridges, dams etc) 
  - earthworks ::  tunnels, contouring, reclamation


** Alexander's Nine Principles

#+begin_quote
1. Fundementally, architecture is and must be an art of
   making.  The impetus for wholeness guides everything, and
   is the driving force of all construction activity.
   Adaptation is a neccessary aspect of design.  The entire
   production of buildings must be an ongoing, dynamic
   process, alive to the circumstances that emerge day by
   day, and able to develop opportunities and events that
   come to light.

2. In support of this new production system, there will need
   to be sweeping changes in human organization.  These
   changes of organization will provide for involvement and
   coordination among the interested people and skilled
   workers, and thus give a level of deep involvement in
   decision-making by all concerned.  Together, they will
   act on adaptation.

3. A new approach to the management of money will do away
   with the mercenary and profit-driven foundations of the
   building industry.  Money management will need to be
   controlled via non-profit organizations.

4. A major focus on the fragility of human beings and
   whatever enhances their well-being will be respected.
   This will be treated as a major emphasis, and will always
   be considered as a source of feedback and evaluation.

5. So, too, care must be given to all animals, insects, and
   plants, meadows, forests, ice-floes, and other natural
   habitats.  This intense care for all living beings
   and systems will be a priority.

6. The land, (urban and rural) -- its shape, its character
   -- will provide the context for every building project in
   a way that is conscious and careful.  Land configurations
   and old buildings will provide the primary origin of
   buildings and new construction.

7. The shaping of buildings and parts of buildings will
   always be through works of craft, made by human hands
   (though it may include many small prefabricated
   components).  As a whole, every effort is to be
   understood to bea full-fledged work of art.

8. A generative process (something like a pattern language)
   will always be seen as the key dynamic framework that
   gives generic instructions for all planning, design and
   construction.

9. Something we may loosely call "spirit" will be the
   underlying foundation of the work of building.  This
   "spirit" will be held in common, and because of this, the
   buildings we produce will be endowed with spirit
   themselves.

** Shearing Layers

 - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_Buildings_Learn][How Buildings Learn]] - Wikipedia


The idea was first coined by Frank Duffy and further
elaborated by Stewart Brand in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_Buildings_Learn][How Buildings Learn: What
Happens After They’re Built]] as the idea that buildings are
composed of multiple layers that each tend to change over
time at different rates of change.

  - stuff
  - space (layout/plan)
  - services
  - skin
  - structure
  - site

** You Say to Brick

#+begin_quote
... the contrast between these two buildings in fact offers
a brilliantly concrete demonstration of the dual premises
that underlie her book. The first is that architecture
possesses what she describes as a profound capacity to "make
a difference"—to exert a fundamental influence on our
quality of life by literally shaping our activities and
experiences. The second is that this capacity is best
understood not in the abstract terms of aesthetics or
history but by looking closely at the actual mechanics of
our daily interactions with buildings; by trying to
understand how we live in and move through them.

"You say to brick, 'What do you want, brick?' . . . Brick says to you,
'I like an arch.' If you say to brick, 'Arches are expensive, and I
can use a concrete lintel over an opening. What do you think of that,
brick?' Brick says, 'I like an arch.'"

Drawing on speeches and letters from Kahn's time in Dhaka supervising
the construction of his design for the National Assembly Building of
Bangladesh, Lesser suggests that he saw the project not merely as
providing a site for the young nation's parliament to meet but as
physically establishing democracy there—as if the spatial
configuration of his building would bear as much responsibility for
good governance as the legal structure of a constitution.

For Kahn, the ultimate source of architecture's power was its ability
to communicate. He believed that buildings are composed of "universal
elements" that have remained essentially unchanged throughout the
ages, and so constitute a kind of ancestral spatial language shared by
all of humanity.
