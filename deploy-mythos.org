* Introduction

 - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersubjectivity][Intersubjectivity]] | Wikipedia

Myths are not just stories, they provide:

  - communication within and between groups
  - cooperation within and between groups.
  - language, a shared symbol system
  - a cultural encyclopedia (havelock)
  - a collective world view (map)

In a sense all five of these things are different aspects of
the same thing.

We need a way of thinking about all of these aspects:

  - *narrative* -- a thread winding through a map
  - *overlay*   -- a collective map that provides us as a
    group with a shared worldview which we use for
    communication and cooperation.  Mythos is a map.
  - *interface* -- /magic/ is an interface between the
    intersubjective and the objective physical world -- not
    all of the physical world, only the things that we (man)
    can have power over.  Traditionally magic was
    /sympathetic/, /alchemy/ (the foundation for chemistry)
    or /oral/ spells, incantations etc that were based on
    the idea that words had power over the things they
    named.  This is the base concept of programming.  You
    control computational machines using words, magic as
    command line.

The /subjective/ is the map in our head. Mythos and Magic
are a means of pulling together the intersubjective with the
objective.

Speech and writing systems are symbol systems that are
essentially programming languages.

According to Albert A. Anderson, a professor of philosophy, the term
mythos appears in the works of Homer and other poets of Homer's
era.[7] In these works, the term had several meanings: conversation,
narrative, speech, story, tale, and word. Like the related term logos,
mythos expresses whatever can be delivered in the form of words.[7]
Anderson contrasts the two terms with ergon, a Greek term for action,
deed, and work.

The term mythos lacks an explicit distinction between true or false
narratives.

In the debate between cognitive individualism and cognitive
universalism, some aspects of thinking are neither solely personal nor
fully universal. Cognitive sociology proponents argue for
intersubjectivity—an intermediate perspective of social cognition that
provides a balanced view between personal and universal views of our
social cognition. This approach suggests that, instead of being
individual or universal thinkers, human beings subscribe to "thought
communities"—communities of differing beliefs. Thought community
examples include churches, professions, scientific beliefs,
generations, nations, and political movements. This perspective
explains why each individual thinks differently from each another
(individualism): person A may choose to adhere to expiry dates on
foods, but person B may believe that expiry dates are only guidelines
and it is still safe to eat the food days past the expiry date. But
not all human beings think the same way (universalism).

Intersubjectivity argues that each thought community shares social
experiences that are different from the social experiences of other
thought communities, creating differing beliefs among people who
subscribe to different thought communities. These experiences
transcend our subjectivity, which explains why they can be shared by
the entire thought community. Proponents of intersubjectivity
support the view that individual beliefs are often the result of
thought community beliefs, not just personal experiences or universal
and objective human beliefs. Beliefs are recast in terms of standards,
which are set by thought communities.
