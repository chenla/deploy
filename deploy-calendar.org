* Time

Time is almost as confusing as dates.

* Epoch

NOTES <2014-06-08 Sun 17:26> The Clock of Arc Nong Pao
#+end_center

The more I think about the clock for Arc Nong Pao, the more
I think about ritual and participation in the clock, so that
the clock is the accumulation of something done by thousands
of people over hundreds or thousands of generations.

It should be something that people participate in, in a way
that forces them to contemplate time, and how each of their
small efforts contribute to something that is larger then
themselves.

We don't need a mechanical clock to do this.

Imagine a large stepped circle in the middle of a grand
cloister.  The top circle step which is at ground level is
divided into 1,000 segments, with deep, wide groove at each
segment.  In one of these segments sits a large polished
stone ball, perhaps two or three meters in diameter.  The
next step down is another segmented step with a smaller
ball, and a third step with a still smaller ball.

In the middle of this is a 10 meter deep round pit.  At the
bottom of the pit is a penrose tiling.  The penrose tiling
take place over roughly years time.  The year is broken down
in seconds, so the bottom ring represents 1 million seconds.
So the lowest ball is moved to a new segment every million
seconds, or roughly three times a year.

After the lowest ball has moved 1000 times, the second ball,
which represents billions of seconds is moved to the second
grove.  And the cycle repeats on the third step.  After some
360 years, the second ball has completed a full cycle and
the top ball moves to the first second.  The top ball will
move three segments in a thousand years.  At which, the
tiling pit, will have completely filled to ground level.
Tiles are 1 centimeter in thickness, so it will take a
thousand years to fill a ten meter deep pit.

If the clock is still being maintained at this point, a
second it is excavated and the process continues.

The tiles are formed, dried, glazed and baked in a kiln at
the end of each year in preparation for the next layer.

Tile patterns and colors will change every year, and it is
hoped that a great deal of effort will be spent in
developing new tilings.

There will also be solar based terrestrial mechanical
clocks, that will be based on astronomical cycles.

When man becomes a multi-planet species, the long clock will
sync with any other clock on any other world that is within
the same light cone, so long as time is counted from the
same epoch.
