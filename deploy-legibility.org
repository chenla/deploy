Legibility is a term (that may have been) coined by James Scott, which
refers to the mapping of land parcels, organizations and people for
the purpose of making them knowable by the State.

I will make the argument that in the machine and computer age making
things legible is no longer an imposition by States on traditional
complex societies, but is something that needs to be done and used by
everyone, and that a fine-grained, multi-layer, distributed,
federated, and transparent map that provides for a reasonable
expectation (as opposed to absolute) of privacy must become one of the
fundemental cornerstones of a technologically advanced civilization.
When such maps become the proprietary data hoards of the state and
monster companies like Google and Facebook, it will inevitably lead to
power and wealth ibalences that can not be corrected short of
extraordinary measures.  In fact, Google and Facebook arguably know
more about us than the state.  It recently was revealed that Facebook
now is selling advertising based on the emotional state of mind of
teens.  Much of this is because it is not longer enough for
institutions to require legible maps, but any organization and
individual needs them as well which are also legible to all cognitive
machine systems.


* State Legibility

As Scott lays out, in meticulous detail, legibility is all about
States and how they levy taxes, conscript soldiers

To do this they create cadastral maps that indicate property
boundries.  Each property is then entered into a land registry which
is used to levy taxes.  

The second tool is registration and taking regular census of the
population.

Since taxation and suppression of regime change is the only real
purpose for land and population registration.
