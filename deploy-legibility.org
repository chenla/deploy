* Introduction

As Scott lays out, in meticulous detail, legibility is all about
States and how they levy taxes, conscript soldiers

To do this they create cadastral maps that indicate property
boundries.  Each property is then entered into a land registry which
is used to levy taxes.  

The second tool us registration and taking regular census of the
population.

Since taxation and suppression of regime change is the only real
purpose for land and population registration
