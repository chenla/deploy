* Introduction

The problem with text in most scientific papers and books is it is
descriptive -- it doesn't do anything.

We need to spend as much effort on proscriptive texts that are used to
support descriptive texts.  This means not only proscriptive prose,
but CAD files that can be sent to a CNC router or milling or laser
cutting machine.  It means including the code that is used to do the
work, as well as the code used to analyze the data and barf out graphs
and conclusions.  And it means videos (yes, you heard me right) that
document how all of the descriptive and proscriptive materials were
put together and used to do something.

Doesn't matter if you are talking about candle making or reproducing
the double-slit experiment...  first you need a laser that can do
x,y,z.  Here is all the information you need to build a laser that can
meet these requirements, and this is a YouTube video of me making the
laser and testing it....

I hope that this is what the prolog, primer and hoard will do that no
one has done before.

I loved Dartnell's "The Knowledge" but it would be a lot more useful
if everything he talks about included descriptive and proscriptive
information that shows people how to actually do these things under
different conditions....
