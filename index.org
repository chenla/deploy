* About these pages

#+begin_quote
Deploy is basically taking all the work in the prolog,
primer, bmf and the hoard; then config, build and deploy to
create a functioning distributed technological society.

It's not a plan, and it's not top down -- it is a bottom up
iterative process -- which mostly likely /won't work/, but
perhaps will result in some useful things that can be used
and are useful.

Files have different prefixes:

  - deploy :: general concepts & design
  - shop   :: specific shop
  - guild  :: specific guild
  - lab    :: b>i laboratories
  - solar  :: planets for man

We may have to split these up into different repos, but I
still don't know how all of this will shape up.  Time will tell.
