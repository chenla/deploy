* Introduction

* Selfies

for a long time I thought that selfies were basically
vanity, and to some extent this is true, but I've come to
believe that it is more about marking territories

fences and lines on maps...


  - american urban graffiti is on the decline, with the same
    activities moving to social media like instagram (look
    up link)

  - picture of Neal Armstrong on Moon with Flag

  - Picture of Queen Elizabeth I (or was it Victoria?) with
    her hand on the Globe -- there is no question, it is
    /her/ globe
