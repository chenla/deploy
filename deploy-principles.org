* Introduction

Principles are sort of cardinal patterns

** Design

*** Distributed

Centralized is when all nodes point back to a single parent
node.  All roads lead to Rome.

It should be pointed out that there are no centralized
systems in nature, and even when systems in nature depend on
a single point of failure -- that will become one of the
most important causes of failure.  The heart is a good example.

Centralized systems are the easiest way to do things because
you only have to maintain a single set of things.  It's easy
to keep consistent and there is no problem with propagation.
Change something once, it's changed everywhere.  It's no
surprise that centralized systems are favored by those who
prize absolute control.  Ideologies are centralized, they
maintain a single set of facts and beliefs that everyone
must follow.  The same applies to monotheism -- if there is
only a single all powerful god, and that god is believed to
be absolutely good, then how to reconcile pain, suffering,
injustice and other evils in the world.  All sorts of
explanations abound in every monotheistic belief system, and
all of them strain credibility.  So by and large the
contradictions and paradoxes that emerge from monotheistic
belief systems are usually not thought about too much,
because when they are, bad things tend to happen and they
are used to justify some really terrible behavior.  The
chiristian concept of original sin has been used to demean
and repress women in more ways than could every be
documented.  But for original sin to work, the concept that
bad deeds are passed on, like genes from one generation to
another.  This is a wide spread belief throughout human
history.  The sins of the father are passed on to become the
sins of the son.  This is in direct contradiction with the
whole Christian belief that man was given free will.  Free
will means that everyone starts with a clean slate and it is
up to them to do good or bad.  It's never explained how the
sins of Adam and Eve are a curse on all descendents of Adam
and Even, which is everyone.  No one has a clean slate, and
so there are limits to free will - it is not absolute.  The
ancient Greeks would have had no problem with this --
because of their belief in fate -- what happens to us is
determined by outside forces we have no direct means of
knowing about.  But fate was not determined by a single god,
but through the complex and often capricious interaction of
many gods.  It was possible to seek help from one god,
even if another had it in for you.  So fate was not
absolute, and it was possible to influence your fate though
not become in control of it.  The universe is complex and
chaotic to the point where deterministic outcomes are a
matter of probability, which even the gods are subject to.
In many respects the decentralized Greek pantheon of gods is
a better fit with empirical reality than the monotheistic
systems.  But monotheism provides a simple model of the
world and that simplicity is far more comforting than the
messy reality TV shows that are going on on Olympus, or
Valhallah or wherever the Gods are supposed to reside.  It
is a rejection of complexity and contradiction.  It is a
binary system that doesn't reflect the world we experience,
no matter how comforting it may be.  Some of the aspects of
polytheism have hung on in all monothesistic belief systems
in the form of Saints, Angels and Demons.




*** 
  - human readable
  - homoiconographic
  - gracefully degrade
  - standardized parts
  - modular (as in unix pipes)
  - repairable
  - upgradable
  - longevity (as a design principle)
** Social
  - golden rule
