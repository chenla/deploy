* Introduction

A process guild is automated network that combines, distributes,
federates, and automates many aspects of modern palletized,
containerized supply chains and logistics with the idea of distributed
cascading production that displaces centralized factory production.

Palletization and Containerization removed many steps of loading and
unloading of goods from source to destination.  It was neccessary to
load and uload trucks, train cars, planes and ships, by hand.  This
not only took a gret deal of time, but was messy and resulted in many
goods being damaged or stolen along the way.

The system transformed production and international trade, but it
favoured scale.  Production needed to produce goods that could fill
pallets and containers to be economical.  This meant farms needed to
produce a large amount of a few or even a single crop.  Factories
needed to produce many identical copies of the same item.  This has
resulted in the mass-market factory goods that define modern
civilization.

Anything that is custom made must use a far more expensive postal or
delivery network that is designed for end-users and last-mile
delivery.  These have become astonishingly expensive in recent years
as governments no longer treat such services as a public service and
as a for-profit business.  The commerical delivery networks charge
even higher rates on the promise of speed.  For individual delivery,
fast and good has replaced good and cheap.

However, computers, AI and robotics make it possible to add new layers
to the existing logistics and transportation networks that promise to
make small production as if not more efficient than the present
system, and for the goods resulting from the new production processes
to be individually custom made and of far higher quality than is true
today.

Today, we live in a want-based dispsable consumer economy which uses
the enormous savings that assembly lines, palletization and
containerization have made possible to build things that only last a
few years at most and then need to be replaced.  This has degraded
people's lives as much if not more than has given them access to goods
that were out of reach for those with lower income.  And has not
significantly changed their situation because the goods they purchase
must be replaced on a regular bases, which spread over time results in
them spending far more than if they were had a reasonable means of
purchasing high quality goods that would last decades or longer.

need to work out how much waste is being caused in the present system
-- for example, if an old Maytag Washing Machine used to last 20-30
years, but is now replaced every 3-4 years you need to buy nearly 10
washing machines over the same period, and for most of that time they
are not working properly because they are designed to fail...

Supermarkets have enormous amounts of waste, especially in perishible
goods.  Compare that to a wet market where there are many sellers with
only a small amount to sell each, when they sell out they go home.
I'd love to do a study on how efficient such markets are in places
like Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia.

* Discuss

This needs to be moved -- to Process Guilds (need to create)

I think it fits with Alexander's idea of communities
requiring that every addition strengthen what is there.  So
no cookie-cutter template chain stores -- don't ban the
chains, but they will have to adapt to local norms, rather
than impose their copies that destroy the surrounding life
of the community.  They have to become part of the community
-- and that goes far deeper than architecture, the chains
will have to learn to become 'local' shops, that don't push
out existing shops and strengthen those shops.

Hardware stores are a better example than coffee shops -- if
a hardware chain moves in, and sells to their competition as
well as sell through their own shops, they have strengthened
the community and gained instant market-share.  It's like
HugeNet in HK -- Metrolink sold routers and terminal servers
to competing ISPs, it didn't hurt our business, and we made
money from our competition.

Remember, AI & Robots will replace a lot of jobs -- so what
you have left is the supply chain, logistics, economy of
scale, and local service.  The last one is the most
important -- everything else becomes a middleman that AI and
the robots will replace.

This doesn't need to be a zero-sum game between the big and
small players.  Perhaps McDonalds could become a supply
chain and network for other restaurants, instead of just
being in the fast-food retailer business.

But actually this is where the "process guild" network comes
in to provide exactly this.  You don't need McDonalds -- you
need infrastructure with AI and robots that provides this as
a public utility....

   utility as a service, monopoly, or a commons?

And then we turn the tables on the big companies and force
them to buy from the guild-nets, to buy locally, and conform
to local packaging -- so they loose their economy of scale
and all is left is branding and marketing....  and they melt
away, "what a world, what a world"....


The girl at i-Cafe with the pig farm -- how cold guild-nets
solve her problem and stave off bastards like CP?


* Not In My Backyard

When people say "not in my backyard" they are playing with
fire.  Everything is in someone's backyard, by pushing
things away that have potential negative side effects we are
passing the buck.  Rather, we need, as a civilization to use
the clout that comes from having something in your backyard
to change it for the better so it does not become a problem.
We need to give people the ability to change what is in
their backyard for the better, but not 100% block anything
they don't like from moving into the neighborhood.  This is
a balance that has been lost.  The fear is understandable,
because corporation and governments often will do things
without transparency or accountability.  If you have those
two things -- so that you say, okay, you can move in, but we
will want voting seats on your board and in return we will
work with you and not against you.  This should work at a
lot of different scales -- it's not just about pipelines,
nuclear power plants, and windfarms -- it's about Starbucks
opening a shop on a street with four existing small coffee
shops -- and the knowledge that Starbucks will likely drive
three of them out of business.  This is not real 
competition, Starbucks will win because they are large and
the smaller shops are not -- but if the price of Starbucks
coming into that neighborhood required it to work with the
smaller shops -- perhaps by handicapping Starbucks in some
way, and forcing them to compete on the local shop's terms,
or forcing Starbucks to provide supplies to those shops at
the same cost of scale that they enjoy -- there could be a
different outcome -- a lot of it depends on the carrying
capacity on the street for coffee shops -- take away
Starbuck's advantage and perhaps only one of the shops goes
out of business....
