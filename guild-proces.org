* Introduction

A process guild is automated network that combines, distributes,
federates, and automates many aspects of modern palletized,
containerized supply chains and logistics with the idea of distributed
cascading production that displaces centralized factory production.

Palletization and Containerization removed many steps of loading and
unloading of goods from source to destination.  It was neccessary to
load and uload trucks, train cars, planes and ships, by hand.  This
not only took a gret deal of time, but was messy and resulted in many
goods being damaged or stolen along the way.

The system transformed production and international trade, but it
favoured scale.  Production needed to produce goods that could fill
pallets and containers to be economical.  This meant farms needed to
produce a large amount of a few or even a single crop.  Factories
needed to produce many identical copies of the same item.  This has
resulted in the mass-market factory goods that define modern
civilization.

Anything that is custom made must use a far more expensive postal or
delivery network that is designed for end-users and last-mile
delivery.  These have become astonishingly expensive in recent years
as governments no longer treat such services as a public service and
as a for-profit business.  The commerical delivery networks charge
even higher rates on the promise of speed.  For individual delivery,
fast and good has replaced good and cheap.

However, computers, AI and robotics make it possible to add new layers
to the existing logistics and transportation networks that promise to
make small production as if not more efficient than the present
system, and for the goods resulting from the new production processes
to be individually custom made and of far higher quality than is true
today.

Today, we live in a want-based dispsable consumer economy which uses
the enormous savings that assembly lines, palletization and
containerization have made possible to build things that only last a
few years at most and then need to be replaced.  This has degraded
people's lives as much if not more than has given them access to goods
that were out of reach for those with lower income.  And has not
significantly changed their situation because the goods they purchase
must be replaced on a regular bases, which spread over time results in
them spending far more than if they were had a reasonable means of
purchasing high quality goods that would last decades or longer.

need to work out how much waste is being caused in the present system
-- for example, if an old Maytag Washing Machine used to last 20-30
years, but is now replaced every 3-4 years you need to buy nearly 10
washing machines over the same period, and for most of that time they
are not working properly because they are designed to fail...

Supermarkets have enormous amounts of waste, especially in perishible
goods.  Compare that to a wet market where there are many sellers with
only a small amount to sell each, when they sell out they go home.
I'd love to do a study on how efficient such markets are in places
like Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia.

The present system does not factor in real total costs, which include
availability of natural resources, infrastructure for much of the
system including transportation, electricity and fuel, or the
environmental impact. The present system is not-sustainable and is
designed to largely benefit a small percentage of wealthy land and
corporate owners at the expense of everyone else.

* Process Guild

We use the word /guild/ to mean a group of interdendent parts that
must work together, in the sense of the permaculture concept of /crop
guilds/.  We use the word process as in a business process that is
modeled in an ERP software system.  A guild is a holon, in that it can
be seen as a complete semi-autonomous whole, which is made up of parts
which are themselves semi-autonomous wholes.  The structure is in
theory nearly infinitely nestable, so that any process guild may
itself be a part of a larger process guild, and contain parts which
are themselves process guilds as well.  Finally any part of a guild,
be it a mutually exclusive atom (not made up of other parts) or some
global spanning [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matryoshka_doll][matryoshka]] guild can overlap and be part of any other
guild at the same time, forming an overlapping interwoven [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhizome_(philosophy)][rhizomatic]]
structure in which any one point may or may not be connected to any
other point.  Got your head around that yet?  No? Think about it a
while and come back when your ready.  Good now?  Let's continue.

We are used to thinking of business in terms of distinct parts which
happen separately from each other.

  - procurement
  - production
  - logistics

You procure materials that are used in production. Something that is a
material in one context is a product to another.  To a corn farmer,
corn is a product, while water, soil, sunlight fertilizers etc are
material inputs.  To a company that makes cornbread, corn, turned to
cornmeal is a material.

Logistics includes the coordination of transporation physical things
and information from place to place, the farther that something needs
to be moved the more complex -- moving something from Battanbang to
Phnom Penh will typically take place in a single hop, from city to
city, though even then it may go from the sender, to a transporation
company which aggregates multiple items that are destined for Phnom
Penh take them as a single shipment to Phnom Pehn and then arrange to
have them individually picked up and delievered to different
addresses.  In this scenario, it would require three or more hops at
least to reach its destination though it is only moving hundreds of
kilometers.  Most of the cost involved in logistics is taken up in
transfer of goods from different modes of transport between hops, and
the overhead added by each independent operator in the logistic
chain.  This is why intermodal transport has had such an enormous
impact on global commerce -- it effectively slashed 75% or more of
costs of interhop transfer.




So a process guild can be thought of as a temporary or long term chain
of interdependent relationships that form a complete end-to-end
business process.




* It-Torrents


* Discuss

This needs to be moved -- to Process Guilds (need to create)

I think it fits with Alexander's idea of communities requiring that
every addition strengthen what is there.  So no cookie-cutter template
chain stores -- don't ban the chains, but they will have to adapt to
local norms, rather than impose their copies that destroy the
surrounding life of the community.  They have to become part of the
community -- and that goes far deeper than architecture, the chains
will have to learn to become 'local' shops, that don't push out
existing shops and strengthen those shops.

Hardware stores are a better example than coffee shops -- if a
hardware chain moves in, and sells to their competition as well as
sell through their own shops, they have strengthened the community and
gained instant market-share.  It's like HugeNet in HK -- Metrolink
sold routers and terminal servers to competing ISPs, it didn't hurt
our business, and we made money from our competition.

Remember, AI & Robots will replace a lot of jobs -- so what you have
left is the supply chain, logistics, economy of scale, and local
service.  The last one is the most important -- everything else
becomes a middleman that AI and the robots will replace.

This doesn't need to be a zero-sum game between the big and small
players.  Perhaps McDonalds could become a supply chain and network
for other restaurants, instead of just being in the fast-food retailer
business.

But actually this is where the "process guild" network comes in to
provide exactly this.  You don't need McDonalds -- you need
infrastructure with AI and robots that provides this as a public
utility....

   utility as a service, monopoly, or a commons?

And then we turn the tables on the big companies and force them to buy
from the guild-nets, to buy locally, and conform to local packaging --
so they loose their economy of scale and all is left is branding and
marketing....  and they melt away, "what a world, what a world"....


The girl at i-Cafe with the pig farm -- how cold guild-nets solve her
problem and stave off bastards like CP?


* Not In My Backyard

When people say "not in my backyard" they are playing with fire.
Everything is in someone's backyard, by pushing things away that have
potential negative side effects we are passing the buck.  Rather, we
need, as a civilization to use the clout that comes from having
something in your backyard to change it for the better so it does not
become a problem.  We need to give people the ability to change what
is in their backyard for the better, but not 100% block anything they
don't like from moving into the neighborhood.  This is a balance that
has been lost.  The fear is understandable, because corporation and
governments often will do things without transparency or
accountability.  If you have those two things -- so that you say,
okay, you can move in, but we will want voting seats on your board and
in return we will work with you and not against you.  This should work
at a lot of different scales -- it's not just about pipelines, nuclear
power plants, and windfarms -- it's about Starbucks opening a shop on
a street with four existing small coffee shops -- and the knowledge
that Starbucks will likely drive three of them out of business.  This
is not real competition, Starbucks will win because they are large and
the smaller shops are not -- but if the price of Starbucks coming into
that neighborhood required it to work with the smaller shops --
perhaps by handicapping Starbucks in some way, and forcing them to
compete on the local shop's terms, or forcing Starbucks to provide
supplies to those shops at the same cost of scale that they enjoy --
there could be a different outcome -- a lot of it depends on the
carrying capacity on the street for coffee shops -- take away
Starbuck's advantage and perhaps only one of the shops goes out of
business....
