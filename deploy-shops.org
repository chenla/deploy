I've certainly been thinking about this a very long time, and yet here
I am trying to write it all out and I'm a little at a loss.

When I say shop here, I don't mean a retail store, though many shops
will also have a retail front end, like a bakery, deli, repair shop.  But
many shops don't premake retail goods.

A shop is a place where things are made, usually with a master and a
small number of employees and a long time ago, apprentices.

Things are produced that are high in quality, often bespoke, and
artisanal.


shops short for workshop.  I like the french word
/atelier/ because of its connotations with being the home of an
alchemist of wizard (wikipedia: studio).

other terms such as studio and laboratory are also shops but don't
have the retail or commercial connotation that shop has.

more recently the term hackspace has emerged -- which is sort of part
workshop, office, and classroom.
