I've certainly been thinking about this a very long time, and yet here
I am trying to write it all out and I'm a little at a loss.

When I say shop here, I don't mean a retail store, though many shops
will also have a retail front end, like a bakery, deli, repair shop.  But
many shops don't premake retail goods.

A shop is a place where things are made, usually with a master and a
small number of employees and a long time ago, apprentices.

Things are produced that are high in quality, often bespoke, and
artisanal.


shops short for workshop.  I like the french word
/atelier/ because of its connotations with being the home of an
alchemist of wizard (wikipedia: studio).

other terms such as studio and laboratory are also shops but don't
have the retail or commercial connotation that shop has.

more recently the term hackspace has emerged -- which is sort of part
workshop, office, and classroom.


* Shops and Labs

Text based on:  NOTES <2015-11-22 Sun 13:33> Modules -- Shops and Institutes

Since we are trying to build a civilization here -- we need to keep
focused on production -- that means we identify professions which are
made up of a number of specialties, processes and outputs.

So in a way we need to start with workshops -- and what each will
produce, what tools they will use, what processes are used to do
production and then what they can output -- and the goal here is for
each shop to support a bootstrap community of 3-5,000 individuals
which are broken into 30 dunbar unit villages.  That's not right --
each dunbar unit should be of working individuals -- and not count
small children, the ill or elderly who are no longer a productive
segment of society.  At any one time it will also include working
individuals who are taking leave for child rearing, or sabbaticals
etc.

So in a sense we are starting with the plan of St Gall -- with all of
the shops and other organization, and use this as a baseline, sort of
like Websters Dict was used by the OED...
