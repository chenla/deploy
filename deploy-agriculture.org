The thing is, there are lots of brilliant people who have
put together pieces of what is happening.  But each is
limited to a subset of disciplines.  You see the computer
people talk about robots and AI, the folks in the life
sciences about biotech, the engineers, physicists
about nanotech, the ecologists and farmers about
permaculture and some GMO, and the economists
about.... well, economies.  But each of these groups could
apply what they are doing and predicting to the other groups
and no one seems to understand how all of this works
together.

The rapture of the nerds crowd aren't talking about gene
splicing, and the nanotech folks aren't talking about
growing automobile bodies from biological materials.

But if you put the ai and nano and bio and eco together you
get something that is very different from what you read
about -- I don't know what that is, but it is bigger and
weirder and wilder than we now know.

This is where I hope I can come in.  I'm a computer guy, so
that's where I started, now I am adding eco/agro to that,
and still need to understand more about nano and bio.

What I have written about to date about the coming stage
after globalization, which is economics, and ai and robotics
is starting to include a shift in agricultural practice.

But what about nano and bio?  What is genetic technology
really going to change?  Longer life, smarter or tailor made
babies and vat grown meat are all most people hear about --
but how is taking control of evolutionary processes really
going to work?

There have been a lot of different scenarios written about
nano-tech, my favorite being the Diamond Age -- but the book
doesn't really touch on biotech at all -- everything is
through the nanotech lense.

All of these different things will have a cumulative effect
that will be different from what we are talking about now.

Diamond Age was about manual manipulation of matter at an
atomic level.  But life does that already -- it will likely
be that nano will be something closer to an engineered
biological process than the nano people envision today.  And
because of that, we won't get identical copies of nano
reproduction.  Rather it will be a spectrum -- and then,
these creations will likely have DNA and can then be
recombined which will in effect mean that manufactured goods
could evolve on their own (in a directed fashion) to
improve.

In other words, the future isn't 3D printing and fabrication
-- it will be organically grown stuff that will then be
lightly fabricated into final shape.

Engineering and biology will converge.  And computational
hardware will be the same.  AI will increasingly become more
like biological systems but in ways that are vastly
different from what we can imagine today.

Every human society that has relied on annual crops as
staple foods in their diet has collapsed. Every single
one. Every human society from the temperate zone to the
tropics that has relied on annuals to feed itself, is now
gone. And the rich, abundant ecosystems where their
temporary societies once flourished have been rendered into
dust.

The complexities of how each one of these societies has
disappeared are too detailed and numerous to list here.
Religion, politics, war, disease, economic inequity, and
invasion have all played a role in the various collapsed
societies, but the one thing they have all had in common is
the reliance on annual crops as their food. How could this
be a cause of collapse?

The Flemish chemist Jan Baptist van Helmont, starting in
1643, performed an experiment that many of us learned about
in grade school science class. In the spring of that year,
van Helmont filled a large planter barrel with a carefully
measured quantity of soil and planted a willow cutting in
it. For five years he tended the tree giving it plenty of
water. At the end of that time he removed the tree, roots
and all, and weighed it. It weighed nearly 165 lbs. To
almost everybody’s surprise, the soil weighed the same as it
originally had. In reaching for an explanation, van Helmont
theorized that the material that made up the five-year-old
willow tree must have come from the water that he had
added. Later experiments however, showed that the majority
of the tree’s body came from the atmosphere.

The habits need to be designed with a thousand year plan, so
that they gradually become the surface of the terraformed
planet.

When we finally create a habitable atmosphere, the roof on
all of the habitats can be removed and habitats become part
of the planet's surface.

Craters seem to be the way to go here.  The question then
becomes how to build domes that will last a centuries that
will provide enough space to grow old-growth forests?

* Introduction

The deeper I dive into agriculture and permaculture that
strikes me most is the shear amount of knowledge required to
do this stuff.  A master always makes things look easy, but
as you watch a video of Sepp Holtzer casually stroll around
his terraces, planting trees or broadcast sowing seed it's
not obvious how much experience and knowledge there  is
behind those careless looking actions.  When he looks at
plants or soil, or rain, wind, or when a chicken is scratches
in the dirt, he sees things that most people will never
see.

This is the difference between monoculture farming and
polyculture.  Monoculture is not trivial to learn, but it
isn't that difficult either.  But polyculture requires you
to absorb and internalize encyclopedic knowledge of complex
interconnected systems that span many disciplines.

So how can such farming become widespread if the learning
curve is basically a lifetime?

And where can you learn it when there are so few masters,
and books and youtube will only get you so far...

Can we start to build intelligent systems that leverage not
only satellite imagry, and a handful of sensors to do much
more?  There is no replacement for a farmer walking the
land.  But can we provide augmented reality to those walks
so that when a farmer is learning, the system can teach.
And after one becomes a master the system can learn from the
master?

This will require very good image processing, and machine
learning so that systems can look at a wall of vegetation
and estimate how many of each kind of plant is there.
Identify fungus and molds, birds and insects.

** Quonset Tunnels (bamboo framed, paneled high-tunnels)

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytunnel][Polytunnel]] | Wikipedia (akak high-tunnel, hoop-house)
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quonset_hut][Quonset hut]] | Wikipedia

Today I was working on the concept of high tunnels.  Tunnels
are useful for controling, temperature, air-flow, water, and
sunlight.

Tunnels are used to extend growing seasons and to mitigate
environmental extremes.   Tunnels can be covered in plastics
that let in light, but protect from excess rains.  They can
also be fine-meshed screens to let in air, some rain, but
keep out bugs.

All of the designs I've seen so far, use metal frames that
have large single sheets of fabric that cover the entire
frame.

In the semi-tropics we have problems with pests, excess
light and heat, humidity, water (with no drainage) but not
cold.

I'm thinking of breaking up tunnels into panels that can be
made of of a variety of different materials that can then be
mixed and matched to create different solutions.

I love the idea of rails to slide tunnels from plot to
plot.  But a modular panel solution isn't too difficult
either.  Here in Phnom Penh it's common to see tents
errected in an hour or so for weddings and funerals.  Their
system is modular and a team of 5-10 people can assemble and
tear down a large tent very quickly.

I also like the idea of using bamboo for the panel frames.
Bamboo has the advantage of not needing to bring in an
outside shop to be able to repair or replace a panel.  Bend
the pole when green, treat with borax salt and red chili
pepper and you're done.

What could be a challenge is keeping spaces between panels
waterproof.  There are a number of solutions to this but it
will take experiments in the field to see what works.

I would also like to incorporate heat chimneys to help move
air to supplement or replace fans.  There is also the
possibility of incorporating swamp coolers that use
falling water instead of mist -- these work well in Thailand
on battery hen shacks.

I'm also thinking of using tunnels on top of paddies -- rice
has pest and rotting problems that screens and water
protection could help with.  For small farms this would be
an important way of protecting plantings where loosing a
whole paddy would be economically significant.

The shape of a high-tunnel or poly-tunnel is often not the
same as a quonset hut, which is semi-circular.  A
high-tunnel has vertical sides -- but can have a semi
circular roof.
