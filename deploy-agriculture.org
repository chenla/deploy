** Quonset Tunnels (bamboo framed, paneled high-tunnels)

Today I was working on the concept of high tunnels.  Tunnels
are useful for controling, temperature, air-flow, water, and
sunlight.

Tunnels are used to extend growing seasons and to mitigate
environmental extremes.   Tunnels can be covered in plastics
that let in light, but protect from excess rains.  They can
also be fine-meshed screens to let in air, some rain, but
keep out bugs.

All of the designs I've seen so far, use metal frames that
have large single sheets of fabric that cover the entire
frame.

In the semi-tropics we have problems with pests, excess
light and heat, humidity, water (with no drainage) but not
cold.

I'm thinking of breaking up tunnels into panels that can be
made of of a variety of different materials that can then be
mixed and matched to create different solutions.

I love the idea of rails to slide tunnels from plot to
plot.  But a modular panel solution isn't too difficult
either.  Here in Phnom Penh it's common to see tents
errected in an hour or so for weddings and funerals.  Their
system is modular and a team of 5-10 people can assemble and
tear down a large tent very quickly.

I also like the idea of using bamboo for the panel frames.
Bamboo has the advantage of not needing to bring in an
outside shop to be able to repair or replace a panel.  Bend
the pole when green, treat with borax salt and red chili
pepper and you're done.

What could be a challenge is keeping spaces between panels
waterproof.  There are a number of solutions to this but it
will take experiments in the field to see what works.

I would also like to incorporate heat chimneys to help move
air to supplement or replace fans.  There is also the
possibility of incorporating swamp coolers that use
falling water instead of mist -- these work well in Thailand
on battery hen shacks.

I'm also thinking of using tunnels on top of paddies -- rice
has pest and rotting problems that screens and water
protection could help with.  For small farms this would be
an important way of protecting plantings where loosing a
whole paddy would be economically significant.

The shape of a high-tunnel or poly-tunnel is often not the
same as a quonset hut, which is semi-circular.  A
high-tunnel has vertical sides -- but can have a semi
circular roof.
