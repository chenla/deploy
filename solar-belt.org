* Introduction

  - [[https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/asteroids/indepth][Asteroids - In Depth | Planets - NASA Solar System Exploration]] 

* Asteroid classes

  - C-type (chondrite) most common, clay and silicate rocks, 
    and are dark in appearance.
  - S-types ("stony") silicate materials and nickel-iron.
  - M-types are metallic (nickel-iron)


  Main asteroid belt -- swath of asteroids between Mars and Jupiter,
  thoght to contain 1.1-1.9M asteroids larger than 1km in diameter.

  Trojans -- share orbit with a larger planet but do not collide, they
  are located at L4 andL5 lagrange points which are balanced between
  the planet and sun's gravitational field.

  Near Earth asteroids -- asteroids that pass close to the earth
